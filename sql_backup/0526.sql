Rainfall rates over the ocean could be as high as 190mm per hour.</p><p>As Nepartak\'s eye makes landfall, it will lift the Pacific\'s surface by between one and two metres in what is known as a \"storm surge\". This is often the most devastating element of a typhoon, being similar to a small tsunami.</p><p>In the case of Super Typhoon Nepartak, the wind could also be destructive. Steady winds of 230 kilometres an hour will be boosted by gusts as high as 280km/h.</p><p>Curiously, this is the second typhoon called Nepartak, the first being a mere category 1 storm that hit the Philippines in November 2003.</p><p>Appropriately, the epithet Nepartak is derived from the name of a conquering warrior from the island of Kosrae in Micronesia.</p><p>Nepartak is likely to lose a lot of energy over Taiwan, but it is forecast to regain some strength over the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>The Chinese mainland is then under threat, mostly from torrential rainfall, as Nepartak makes landfall on the vulnerable coast of Fujian Province.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.aljazeera.com//mritems/Images/2016/7/7/c61fe7dcc6b747b0a904adde8906bc6e_18.jpg'),(11,'https://www.aljazeera.com//news/2017/05/taiwan-top-court-rules-favour-gay-marriage-170524063603646.html','Aljazeera',NULL,'Taiwan top court rules in favour of gay marriage','Judges on the island say current laws violate constitutional rights, but conservatives angered by ruling.',NULL,NULL,'2017-05-24T21:09:33Z',1495660173000,'<p>A top Taiwan court ruled in favour of gay marriage on Wednesday, a landmark ruling that paves the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex unions.</p><p>Twelve of 14 judges in the court, known as the Judicial Yuan, said current marriage laws violate the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.</p><p>It gave Taiwan\'s government two years to implement the ruling.</p><p>Video posted to social media showed crowds cheering and waving rainbow flags outside parliament in Taipei after the announcement was made.</p><p>Activists were already optimistic the decision would go in their favour.</p><p>But conservative groups had staged mass rallies against a change in the law.</p><p>At the heart of the case was a clause in Taiwan\'s Civil Code that an agreement to marry should be made between a man and a woman.</p><p>This \"violated\" the constitution\'s guarantees of freedom of marriage and people\'s equality, the court said.</p><p> WATCH: Demanding gay rights in Taiwan (2:29)</p><p>Chi Chia-wei, a 59-year-old gay rights campaigner who brought the case to the constitutional court, had urged judges to allow same-sex couples to register to marry the next day if they approved the change.</p><p>The Taipei city government, which also launched a case, had been rejecting marriage applications by same-sex couples and was seeking clarification of the law.</p><p>Al Jazeera\'s Adrian Brown, reporting from Taipei, said: \"Taiwan has in a sense become a beacon of gay rights.\"</p><p>He added that conservatives were likely to protest against the proposed change of law over the next two years and to call for a referendum.</p><p>\"They are angry and disappointed,\" Brown said. \"They say it\'s time for all Taiwanese people to have their say in this debate, and claim a cultural convention is under attack.\"</p><h2>\'Historic\' day in Asia</h2><p>Lawyer Huang Di-ying said the court\'s decision was \"historic\". </p><p>\"It will be a barometer of human rights protection in the region as Asia follows the United States\' and Europe\'s steps to recognise same-sex marriages,\" he said.

Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s the US established what became known as its \"One-China\" policy.</p><p>It recognised the Communist-run government in Beijing as the country\'s sole legitimate government.

In January, Xi Jinping said Taiwan \"must and will be\" reunited with China.</p><p>One of the easter eggs in Devotion is a poster containing the words \"Xi Jinping\" next to \"Winnie the Pooh\", in an ancient style of writing. Winnie the Pooh has been censored on Chinese search engines and social media since 2017, after bloggers began comparing Mr Xi to the children\'s story book and film character.</p><p>Gamers have also spotted an old newspaper in Devotion that refers to an individual who has received a prison sentence, nicknamed \"baozi\" or \"steamed bun\". </p><p>\"Steamed bun\" is another sensitive term in China, as social media users have used it to refer to the president and evade government censors.</p><p>Red Candle Games confirmed that Devotion had been removed from Steam China on 23 February, and issued an apology, saying the poster with the Winnie the Pooh reference had made it into the game by accident due to a technical issue.</p><p>It said that it was aware some players may have been offended by the images, and said that it was in touch with Steam to ensure that such players could obtain a full refund. </p><p>\"The whole team of Red Candle Games bears the responsibility of this awfully unprofessional mistake,\" a statement on Monday said. \"It is not Red Candle\'s vision to secretly project extensive ideology, nor is it to attack any person in the real world.</p><p>\"We sincerely hope that this ends with Red Candle, and please do not take it out on all of our innocent partners.\" </p><p>Taiwanese Vice Premier Chen Chi-mai has praised the game, saying: \"Only in countries with democracy and freedom can creation be free from restrictions.\"</p><p>Chinese online censors, meanwhile, are trying to scrub references to the game and its hidden messages.</p><p>Searches for both \"Red Candle Games\" and \"Devotion\" in Chinese on Weibo are showing no results.</p><p>What\'s On Weibo, which tracks content on the site, said that over the weekend posts containing the hashtag #Devotion were racking up hundreds of millions of views.</p><p>But on Monday, a search of the hashtag #Devotion showed only four posts, none of which refer to the game. </p><p>Posts that mention the game\'s title in English, which the censors are often lax in censoring, show that China-based users are receiving messages on Steam saying that the game is \"no longer available\" to play in their country. </p><p>Meanwhile Red Candle\'s account on China\'s Twitter-like Sina Weibo service has been suspended, preventing the company from publicising its game in the mainland. </p><p>In Taiwan, where social media is not government-controlled, thousands of social media users are joking about the easter eggs.</p><p>Some on Facebook are posting pictures and gifs of Winnie the Pooh, and others are showing printouts of the offending poster. </p><p>The episode has raised questions as to whether Steam will be the latest overseas online platform to be blocked in mainland China. </p><p>Technically, Steam has not gained official approval to operate in the country, but it remains accessible.

Most were Hoklo Chinese from Fujian (Fukien) province or were Hakka Chinese, largely from Guangdong. The descendants of these two migrations now make up by far the largest population group.</p><p>In 1895, following Japan\'s victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government had no choice but to cede Taiwan to Japan.</p><p>But after World War Two, the Republic of China - one of the victors - began ruling Taiwan with the consent of its allies the US and UK, after Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China.</p><p>However in the next few years, the leader at the time Chiang Kai-shek\'s troops were beaten back by the Communist armies under Mao Zedong.</p><p>Chiang and the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government fled to Taiwan in 1949. This group, referred to as Mainland Chinese and then making up 1.5m people, dominated Taiwan\'s politics for many years, even though they only account for 14% of the population.</p><p>Having inherited an effective dictatorship, facing resistance from local people resentful of the 228 Massacre and authoritarian rule, and under pressure from a growing democracy movement, Chiang\'s son, Chiang Ching-kuo, began allowing a process of democratisation, which eventually led to the 2000 election of the island\'s first non-KMT president, Chen Shui-bian.</p><p>After decades of hostile intentions and angry rhetoric, relations between China and Taiwan started improving in the 1980s. China put forward a formula, known as \"one country, two systems\", under which Taiwan would be given significant autonomy if it accepted Chinese reunification. </p><p>The offer was rejected, but Taiwan did relax rules on visits to and investment in China. It also, in 1991, proclaimed the war with the People\'s Republic of China over.</p><p>There were also limited talks between the two sides\' unofficial representatives, though China\'s insistence that the Republic of China (ROC) government is illegitimate prevented government-to-government contact.</p><p>Beijing became alarmed in 2000, when Taiwan elected as president Chen Shui-bian, who had openly backed independence. </p><p>Mr Chen was re-elected in 2004, prompting China to pass a so-called anti-secession law in 2005, stating China\'s right to use \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it tried to secede from China.</p><p>In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president. He sought to improve relations with China, mainly through economic agreements.</p><p>In elections in January 2016, Tsai Ing-wen defeated Kuomintang party candidate Eric Chu. Mr Ma was barred by Taiwan\'s constitution from the seeking a third term in office. Ms Tsai leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leans towards independence from China.</p><p>After Donald Trump won the 2016 US election, she spoke to the president-elect in a phone call, in what was a break with US policy set in 1979 when formal relations were cut.</p><p>Throughout 2018, China stepped up pressure on international companies forcing them to list Taiwan as a part of China on their websites and threatening to block them for doing business in China if they failed to comply. </p><p>In November, Ms Tsai\'s political party received a heavy setback in regional elections perceived by Beijing as a blow to her separatist stance.</p><p>There is disagreement and confusion about what Taiwan is, and even what it should be called. </p><p>Chiang Kai-shek\'s Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China\'s seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government.</p><p>But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen to about 20.</p><p>China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan\'s leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. </p><p>It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces.</p><p>Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has most of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear.</p><p>While political progress has been slow, links between the two peoples and economies have grown sharply. Taiwanese companies have invested about $60bn (£40bn) in China, and up to one million Taiwanese now live there, many running Taiwanese factories.</p><p>Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China\'s own economy.</p><p>A controversial trade agreement sparked the \"Sunflower Movement\" in 2014 where students and activists occupied Taiwan\'s parliament protesting against what they call China\'s growing influence over Taiwan.</p><p>Officially, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) still favours eventual independence for Taiwan, while the KMT favours eventual re-unification. Opinion polls show only a small minority of Taiwanese support pursuing one or the other at the moment, with most preferring to stick with the current middle ground.</p><p>Yet more and more people say they feel Taiwanese rather than Chinese.

I can assure you that I, and my department, will continue to closely monitor developments in Hong Kong,\" Hunt said, according to a copy of the letter Patten shared with UK-based pressure group Hong Kong Watch. </p><p>\"It is clear that the relatively short formal consultation process has not been sufficient to capture the wide-ranging views on this important topic.</p><p>While Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, the city operates its own legal and political system, and citizens enjoy a number of freedoms not protected on the mainland. At present, Hong Kong does not have an extradition law with China, Taiwan or Macau, a situation officials in the city say has created loopholes preventing criminals from being brought to justice. </p><p>Fear that the law will allow dissidents and pro-democracy activists to be bundled over the border to China has dogged the bill since it was first suggested, however. </p><p>Business groups too have expressed concerns, prompting the government to remove nine economic crimes from the list of potentially extraditable offenses. The government also changed the minimum severity of offense from those carrying one year in prison to three. </p><p>In a statement responding to those changes, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said members continued \"to have serious concerns about the revised proposal.\"</p><p>\"Those concerns flow primarily from the fact that the new arrangements could be used for rendition from Hong Kong to a number of jurisdictions with criminal procedure systems very different from that of Hong Kong -- which provides strong protections for the legitimate rights of defendants -- without the opportunity for public and legislative scrutiny of the fairness of those systems and the specific safeguards that should be sought in cases originating from them,\" the AmCham statement said. </p><p>\"We strongly believe that the proposed arrangements will reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations.\"</p><p>Responding to reporter\'s questions about the law last month, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the extradition law was part of the city\'s \"international commitment to fight organized crime.\"</p><p>He said the foreign business community should support the effort, which \"will benefit (the) business environment.\" </p><p>\"If the accusation is that somebody may unwittingly become a political offender, then I have said repeatedly that the law at present, under our Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has clearly stated that this will not be possible,\" Lee added. </p><p>\"There is a provision to say that no matter how you purport that offense to be, if it relates to political opinion, religion, nationality or ethnicity, then it will not be surrenderable.\"</p><p>AmCham\'s statement is part of a growing chorus of condemnation of the law from multiple quarters. Critics of the law point to past situations where people have been snatched in Hong Kong and transported to China to face trial, including multiple booksellers and Chinese businessman Xiao Jianhua. </p><p>Last week, the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said the new law could enable the Chinese government to extradite reporters critical of Beijing, saying it would \"not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong.\"</p><p>\"Over the years, numerous journalists have been charged or harassed by mainland authorities with criminal allegations covered by the (law),\" it said.</p><p>\"The (law) will make it possible for mainland authorities to get hold of journalists in Hong Kong (on) all kinds of unfounded charges.

In both cases, the CCP has gotten very close to or inside the political core, if you will, of both countries,\" Mattis told the commission.</p><p>Juggling the relationship with the US and China has become increasingly difficult for New Zealand, with relations between the two giants souring amid US President Donald Trump\'s escalating trade war.</p><p>Tensions with Beijing reached a new level in 2018 when New Zealand\'s Government Communications Security Bureau blocked Chinese technology company Huawei from providing 5G technology to one of the country\'s major telecommunication companies, Spark.</p><p>The US has been putting pressure on its allies and diplomatic partners to ditch Huawei over security concerns, a move which has been regularly condemned by Beijing.</p><p>Speaking to CNN in February, Andrew Campbell, a spokesman for Ardern, said the relationship had suffered some \"irritation ... because of the GCSB\'s decision regarding Huawei.\" </p><p>When asked whether Huawei would be on the agenda this weekend, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang evaded the question. </p><p>Ardern on the back foot</p><p>In recent months, Ardern has found herself under greater pressure from opposition politicians and critics to defend the strength of New Zealand\'s relationship with China.</p><p>In February, Ardern was forced to deny that China was deliberately dragging out the visa process for New Zealander diplomats and postponing trips by officials to Beijing.  </p><p>The same month, local media reported an Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai was mysteriously forced to turn back to Auckland on discovering that its paperwork referred to the disputed island of Taiwan. </p><p>At the time, Ardern denied it was a \"relationship\" issue with China, saying instead it was an administrative error.</p><p>But the postponement of a major Chinese-New Zealand tourism event that same month -- which Ardern put down to a scheduling issue -- also added to speculation of a rift.</p><p>Ardern\'s trip also comes at a sensitive time for New Zealand, just two weeks after the terrorist attack against two mosques in Christchurch in which 50 people died. She even said she would be cutting her trip to China short, as it didn\'t seem \"appropriate\" to be overseas at such a time.</p><p>Following global praise for her handling of the tragedy, the New Zealand leader has come under pressure from human rights group to raise the issue of China\'s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims with Xi. Up to two million Uyghurs have reportedly been detained in detention centers in the western region of Xinjiang, according to US government reports.</p><p>\"Given I\'ve raised it before, that should give you an indication,\" she said when asked by reporters this week.</p><p>Prior to her trip, a spokesman for the Prime Minister denied again that she was concerned about the relationship with China worsening under her leadership. \"China is one of our most important and far-reaching relationships. Our relationship is mature and resilient,\" the spokesman said.  </p><p>China researcher Young agreed with the official line.</p><p>\"I think if the relationship really was deteriorating in that way, then it would be far clearer. I think China would be a lot more blunt in the message if it was wanting to send a message,\" he said.</p><p>Wider strains</p><p>Increasingly, the Pacific -- a region where New Zealand has long been a significant player -- is shaping up to be a new battleground for influence.</p><p>China has promised billions of dollars of aid and support in the region and, if it follows through, could overtake Australia as the biggest donor to the Pacific nations.</p><p>New Zealand has also been ramping up spending. Last year, the government announced it would boost aid in the region by 714 million New Zealand dollars ($484 million) as part of its \"Pacific Reset\" strategy -- a move commentators said was at least partly driven by China\'s growing influence in the area.</p><p>\"Our eyes are wide open to New Zealand\'s decreasing influence in the Pacific and we are committed to resetting our approach to working with the Pacific,\" Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said in June last year. </p><p>Despite the numerous points of friction, Stephen Jacobi, the executive director of the New Zealand China Council, isn\'t panicking. Instead, Jacobi said, the biggest fear is that tiny New Zealand becomes irrelevant. </p><p>\"The reality is we are a small country and the Chinese don\'t get up every day thinking about how they can do nice things for New Zealand,\" he said. \"That means we need to be careful in the way we do things -- but we are never going to agree on everything with China.\"</p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318181621-jacinda-ardern-march-18-story-body.jpg','[\"321\", \"313\", \"134\"]',1,'新西蘭與中國的特殊關係正在醞釀之中。 Jacinda Ardern的北京之行可以保存嗎？','null','美國前政府分析家彼得·馬蒂斯在2018年4月向美中經濟與安全審查委員會發表的一份特別聲明中表示，鑑於新西蘭與北京的關係，應對其進行審查。','<p>香港（美國有線電視新聞網）新西蘭總理約翰基於2008年上任六個月後，他正在北京人民大會堂用餐，中共領導。 </p><p>幾個月前簽署了一項自由貿易協定，當時中國國務院總理溫家寶告訴Key，中新關係處於“歷史上最好的”狀態。 </p><p>十年後，新西蘭總理雅辛達·阿登（Jacinda Ardern）任職近18個月訪問中國。 </p><p>週日準備在北京與中國國家主席習近平會面時，兩國關係看起來要復雜得多。 </p><p> “新西蘭致力於與中國保持建設性和全面的關係，”阿爾登週一宣布此次訪問時表示。 </p><p>但新西蘭當代中國研究中心主任傑森楊說，過去幾年，兩國之間出現了越來越多的問題。 </p><p> “其中一些問題是由於中國本身的變化，”他說。 </p><p>緊張局勢日益加劇</p><p>中國與新西蘭的關係是Ardern的前任一直關注培養的關係。 </p><p>在擔任領導的八年期間，Key曾六次訪問該國。在總理海倫·克拉克（Helen Clark）的領導下，2008年新西蘭成為第一個與中國簽署自由貿易協定的發達國家。 </p><p>今天，中國是新西蘭最大的貿易夥伴。據新西蘭外交和貿易部稱，2018年兩國之間的雙向貿易價值超過190億美元（280億新西蘭元）。中國也是新西蘭第二大旅遊市場和最大的國際學生來源。 </p><p>然而，惠靈頓與北京的關係引發了對新西蘭長期盟友美國的警鐘。 </p><p>新西蘭與華盛頓一起，是名為“五眼”的獨家情報共享社區的成員，該社區也包括英國，加拿大和澳大利亞。 </p><p>美國前政府分析家彼得·馬蒂斯在2018年4月向美中經濟與安全審查委員會發表的一份特別聲明中表示，鑑於新西蘭與北京的關係，應對其進行審查。 </p><p> “澳大利亞和新西蘭都面臨著中共干涉的實質性問題。在這兩種情況下，如果你願意的話，中共已經非常接近或在政治核心內部，”馬蒂斯告訴委員會。 </p><p>對於新西蘭來說，處理與美國和中國的關係變得越來越困難，兩大巨頭之間的關係正在美國總統唐納德特朗普不斷升級的貿易戰中徘徊。 </p><p>新西蘭政府通信安全局阻止中國科技公司華為向該國主要電信公司之一Spark提供5G技術，2018年北京的緊張局勢達到了新的水平。 </p><p>美國一直在向其盟國和外交夥伴施加壓力，要求華為放棄安全問題，此舉一直受到北京方面的譴責。 </p><p> Ardern的發言人安德魯•坎貝爾（Andrew Campbell）在2月份對美國有線電視新聞網（CNN）發表講話說，由於GCSB對華為的決定，這種關係遭受了一些“激怒”。 </p><p>當被問及華為是否會在本週末提上日程時，中國外交部發言人耿爽迴避了這個問題。 </p><p>後腳上的Ardern </p><p>最近幾個月，Ardern發現自己面臨來自反對派政治家和批評者的更大壓力，以捍衛新西蘭與中國關係的力量。 </p><p>今年2月，阿爾登被迫否認中國故意拖延新西蘭外交官的簽證程序，並將官員的旅行推遲到北京。 </p><p>同月，當地媒體報導，新西蘭航空公司飛往上海的航班神秘地被迫返回奧克蘭，發現其文書工作涉及有爭議的台灣島嶼。 </p><p>當時，Ardern否認這是與中國的“關係”問題，而是說這是一個行政錯誤。 </p><p>但是同一個月中國 -

Between 2016 and 2017, half the corals at the Great Barrier Reef were killed by two ocean heat waves. </p><p>Almost three-quarters of the world\'s coral reefs were affected by those heat waves and experts say warmer oceans mean these sorts of die-offs will become much more common.</p><p>Another problem for sea life is that increased flooding causes more nutrients to be washed into the sea. This leads to plankton blooms and ultimately causes some parts of the sea to be starved of oxygen, making it hard for fish to live there.</p><p>Warm oceans hold less oxygen, which makes the problem worse. Simpson says some areas of Japan, Taiwan and the Baltic Sea are seeing dramatic die-offs of fish because of low oxygen.</p><p>Food security</p><p>Fish species respond to warmer oceans by migrating to cooler areas, says Simpson. But the waters in some parts of the world are getting too warm for any fish -- and that could lead to food shortages in those areas.</p><p>\"There is a severe food security risk in the tropics,\" says Simpson. \"No species are already activated to temperatures warmer than the tropics, so you could see a real crash in food fish populations. And these are places where coastal nations often have no other protein in the diet other than the fish from coral reefs.\"</p><p>Melting sea ice</p><p>Warmer seas are causing sea ice to melt. Sea ice floats on the ocean surface, so when it melts it doesn\'t affect sea levels.

Finally, the 48-year-old, who requested anonymity, visited National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.</p><p>A brief physical examination by Dr. Wei Li Chen and Dr. Chia-Chieh Hsiao, physicians and researchers in the hospital\'s Department of Ophthalmology, revealed left eyelid bruising and an artfully, if painfully, distorted left pupil.</p><p>The eye\'s single opening, the pupil is an aperture through which light travels to reach the retina, a thin layer of tissue lining the back wall of the eye. The retina\'s photoreceptor cells convert light into signals sent to the back of the brain, where the visual cortex assembles the information and decides what is being seen.</p><p>The patient sat behind a slit lamp so his doctors could perform a more thorough inspection of his injured left eye. </p><p>The slit lamp, ubiquitous in eye doctor offices, is the clunky tool that requires you to rest your chin on one support and place your forehead against another while your uncomfortably close doctor peers through a microscope into your eyes. The slit lamp focuses a narrow band of light into the eyes, providing a magnified, three-dimensional view of both front and back of the \"windows of the soul.\"</p><p>This second examination of the patient\'s left eye revealed an iris \"with the upper portion sagging downward, detached from the 9 o\'clock position to the 3 o\'clock position,\" Chen and Hsiao wrote in a case study on the man\'s injury, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. </p><p>A separation of the iris like this \"can cause multiple pupils, leading to monocular double vision, blurry vision or photophobia\" (an inability to tolerate light), they told CNN in an email.</p><p>So what caused the rare injury? A rubber bungee cord that the man used to strap goods onto a motorcycle had struck him directly in the eye.</p><p>The iris is \"what we recognize as the colored part of the eye,\" explained Dr. Nicholas P. Bell, a professor of ophthalmology and visual science with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston. </p><p>\"Muscles in the iris can cause the pupil to open or close to control how much light gets into the eye under different ambient lighting conditions, similar to how you can adjust the aperture on a camera lens,\" said Bell, who did not treat this particular patient. In a dark room, the pupil opens wide to let in more light, and on a sunny day, the pupil will constrict to reduce the amount of incoming light.  </p><p>Though Chen and Hsiao saw no evidence of cataract, retinal injury or lens dislocation, the separation of the iris from the band of muscles that sits behind it easily accounted for the patient\'s blurred and double vision. This damage is known as traumatic iridodialysis.</p><p>Bell said the condition is \"relatively uncommon,\" though when it does occur, sports or work-related activities are often the cause. But there are others. \"Bungee cord and airbag injuries seem to more frequently result in traumatic iridodialysis because of the focally concentrated strong force,\" Bell said, adding that airbags save lives, and fear of this extremely rare eye injury is no reason for avoiding them.</p><p>Dr. J. Martin Heur, medical director of the USC Roski Eye Institute and associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, agreed that this injury is \"very rare, but I\'ve had a handful of people who\'ve had this happen to them.\" \"The trauma can be caused by anything that doesn\'t penetrate the eye\" but still causes \"the iris to tear at the root like that,\" said Heur, who was not involved in this patient\'s care. Balls such as golf balls are likely culprits, he said.</p><p>To repair the damage, the Taiwanese patient underwent surgery that restored the pupil shape and improved his vision.</p><p>Heur said this surgery, known as iridoplasty, is \"usually done in an operating room\" and \"is relatively short: approximately 30 minutes.\"  The procedure involves McCannel sutures, basically when a surgeon carefully sews the iris back to the inner wall of the eye.</p><p> </p><p>Heur added that after an iridoplasty, a patient has to be careful for about a week or two about lifting heaving objects or getting water in the eye. Once healed, a patient needs to be monitored regularly for life, because glaucoma can develop even years after the injury.</p><p>One year later, the Taiwan patient\'s iris remained attached with only \"mild deformity,\" Chen and Hsiao said. Though there\'s no evidence of glaucoma so far, the patient now wears glasses to help him achieve 20/50 vision in the injured eye: He needs to be within 20 feet to see what people with healthy vision can spot at 50 feet. </p><p>Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, said he saw a similarly severe injury \"after a fisherman had a steel cable snap back into his eye.\" </p><p>\"Because some of the effects of eye trauma can be asymptomatic and appear four to six weeks later, it is important to get a complete eye exam with a professional eye care provider both immediately after severe trauma and a month or two later to be safe,\" said Goldberg, who did not treat the Taiwanese patient.</p><p>Although this level of injury is rare, \"less severe iridodialyses happen more often with moderate to severe eye trauma,\" he said. When small tears occur on the very edge of the iris, they can \"lead to scarring on that area that subsequently blocks the drain of the eye, leading to higher eye pressure and glaucoma.\"</p><p>Dr. Jeff Pettey, an assistant professor at the University of Utah\'s John A. Moran Eye Center, added BB guns and exercise bands to the list of items that can cause an injury like this: \"A young flight attendant used exercise bands when she traveled, and her eye injury resulted in severe eye trauma and a blind eye.\"</p><p>To avoid a similar injury, you can read the American Academy of Ophthalmology\'s website for eye safety tips, a list that includes using protective eyewear whenever playing sports, performing home maintenance ... or using bungee cords.</p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190408141049-collapsed-iris-study-story-body.jpg','[\"402\", \"3\", \"4\"]',1,'眼睛的蹦極導致男人的虹膜塌陷','null','“對患者左眼的第二次檢查顯示虹膜”，上部向下垂，從9點鐘位置分離到3點位置，“陳和蕭在一個關於該男子受傷的案例研究中寫道，週三在新英格蘭醫學雜誌上發表。','<p> （美國有線電視新聞網）整整一周，這名男子左眼疼痛，雙眼視力模糊。最後，這位不願透露姓名的48歲訪問了台北國立台灣大學醫院。 </p><p>醫院眼科的醫生和研究人員Wei Li Chen博士和Chia-Chieh Hsiao博士進行了簡短的身體檢查，發現左眼瞼瘀傷和一個如果疼痛，扭曲的左瞳孔。 </p><p>眼睛的單個開口，瞳孔是一個光線，光線通過該光線到達視網膜，一層薄薄的組織襯在眼睛的後壁上。視網膜的感光細胞將光轉換為發送到大腦後部的信號，視覺皮層匯集信息並決定所看到的內容。 </p><p>患者坐在裂隙燈後面，這樣他的醫生就可以對受傷的左眼進行更徹底的檢查。 </p><p>裂隙燈，在眼科醫生辦公室無處不在，是一種笨重的工具，需要你將下巴放在一個支撐上，並將你的前額放在另一個支撐上，同時你不舒服的近距離醫生通過顯微鏡進入你的眼睛。裂隙燈將窄帶光線聚焦到眼睛中，提供了“靈魂之窗”前後兩側的放大三維視圖。 </p><p>對患者左眼進行的第二次檢查發現虹膜“上部下垂，從9點鐘位置分離到3點位置”，陳和蕭在一份關於該男子受傷的案例研究中寫道，已發表星期三在新英格蘭醫學雜誌。 </p><p>他們在一封電子郵件中告訴美國有線電視新聞網，這樣的虹膜分離“會導致多個瞳孔，導致單眼複視，模糊視力或畏光”（無法忍受光線）。 </p><p>那麼是什麼造成了罕見的傷害？人們用來將貨物綁在摩托車上的橡皮筋將他直接撞到了眼睛裡。 </p><p>虹膜是“我們認為是眼睛的有色部分，”休斯敦UTHealth的麥戈文醫學院眼科學和視覺科學教授Nicholas P.

This is a slight increase from 2017, when 41 were executed. However, in general, the rise is actually small compared to the general downward trend. </p><p>\"There has been a slight increase in the number of executions [in the US], but it is still within historical lows,\" Chiara Sangiorgio, Amnesty International\'s Advisor on the Death Penalty, told CNN. \"Over a 10-year-period, we have seen the number of both executions and death sentences decrease.\"</p><p>The death penalty is rare in the US, but is still legal in most states</p><p>The death penalty is legal in 30 US states, but that number doesn\'t paint an accurate picture of its actual prevalence. For instance, four US states in which the death penalty is legal are under statewide capital punishment moratoriums imposed by their respective governors. Furthermore, there are several states that recognize the death penalty, but haven\'t actually executed anyone in years. </p><p>Sangiorgio says Amnesty International monitors legislative changes and leadership decisions to provide additional insight to their numbers. </p><p>\"We are seeing a few states resume executions after several years, so we find that concerning,\" Sangiorgio says. \"But the trend in the US is positive. [In 2018], Washington became the 20th state to abolish the death penalty. And we recently saw a strong example of leadership coming from California, where [Governor Gavin Newsom] recently suspended the death penalty.\"</p><p>Global and national trends account for other decreases </p><p>Sangiorgio says the historically low number of executions in 2018 was due in part to a significant drop in sentences carried out in some of the world\'s leading executing countries. For instance, Iran has historically been one of the world\'s leading executing countries, and the number of executions there dropped by more than 50% in 2018. </p><p>\"There was a significant drop in executions for drug related offenses in Iran,  because of a change in the laws from last year,\"  Sangiorgio says. Other countries that lead the implementation of the death penalty, like Pakistan and Iraq, saw an ease in unsually high numbers from last year. </p><p>And again, the numbers are only half the story. </p><p>\"There is reason for positive hopes, not only in the drop of executions, but in the number of countries that have decided to abolish the practice,\" Sangiorgio says. \"Burkina Faso, Zambia and Malaysia all abolished or moved toward abolishing the death penalty this year.\" However, she points out that other countries like Japan, Singapore and Taiwan resumed executing people after a period of inactivity. </p><p>When it comes to execution statistics, there is also a China-sized elephant in the room: Since 2009, Amnesty International hasn\'t counted the number of executions reported in China. </p><p>\"China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty; however, available information indicates that each year, thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death,\" the report reads. </p><p>Amnesty International\'s reporting also clarifies that many of their numbers are technically minimum estimates, which is why language like \"at least 690 executions\" is used . </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150812165528-death-row-stories-botched-executions-00004405-story-body.jpg','[\"17\", \"82\", \"107\"]',1,'全球的執行量處於10年來的最低點。但在美國，他們上漲了','null','“[在美國]的處決數量略有增加，但仍處於歷史低位，”國際特赦組織死刑問題顧問Chiara Sangiorgio告訴美國有線電視新聞網。','<p> （美國有線電視新聞網）根據人權組織國際特赦組織的一份新報告，全世界的處決數量達到了10年來的最低點。 </p><p> 2018年在20個國家至少執行了690次處決，比2017年的993次處決或更多處決減少了31％。 </p><p>對於那些認為死刑是殘忍和不人道的做法的人權倡導者來說，這份報告是一個謹慎樂觀的時刻。然而，隨著處決的普遍減少，也有一些令人關注的問題。 </p><p>美國的執行量連續第二年上升</p><p>根據國際特赦組織的報告，2018年美國有45人被處死。這比2017年略有增加，當時有41人被處決。然而，總體而言，與總體下降趨勢相比，上升幅度實際上較小。 </p><p> “[在美國]的處決數量略有增加，但仍處於歷史低位，”國際特赦組織死刑問題顧問Chiara Sangiorgio告訴美國有線電視新聞網。 “在10年的時間裡，我們看到處決和死刑判決的數量都在減少。” </p><p>死刑在美國很少見，但在大多數州仍然合法</p><p>美國30個州的死刑是合法的，但這個數字並沒有準確描繪其實際流行情況。例如，死刑合法的美國四個州都受到各自州長強制執行的全州死刑暫停執行。此外，有幾個州承認死刑，但多年來沒有實際執行任何人。 </p><p> Sangiorgio表示，國際特赦組織負責監督立法變革和領導決策，以便更好地了解他們的數字。 </p><p> “我們看到幾個州在幾年後恢復執行，所以我們發現了這一點，”Sangiorgio說。 “但美國的趨勢是積極的。[在2018年]，華盛頓成為廢除死刑的第20個州。我們最近看到了來自加利福尼亞州的強有力的領導榜樣，[加文新聞總督]最近暫停了死刑“。 </p><p>全球和國家趨勢導致其他減少</p><p> Sangiorgio說，2018年執行死刑的歷史最低，部分原因是世界上一些主要執行國家的刑罰大幅減少。例如，伊朗歷來是世界上最主要的執行國家之一，2018年的處決數量下降了50％以上。 </p><p> Sangiorgio說：“由於法律從去年開始改變，伊朗與毒品有關的罪行的處決率大幅下降。”其他領導執行死刑的國家，如巴基斯坦和伊拉克，從去年開始就看到了非常高的數字。 </p><p>而且，數字只是故事的一半。 </p><p> Sangiorgio說：“有理由抱有積極的希望，不僅是因為執行死亡，而是決定廢除這種做法的國家數量。” “今年，布基納法索，贊比亞和馬來西亞都廢除或逐步廢除死刑。”但是，她指出日本，新加坡和台灣等其他國家在經過一段時間的不活動後恢復執行。 </p><p>在執行統計方面，房間裡還有一頭中國大象：自2009年以來，國際特赦組織沒有計算在中國報告的處決數量。 </p><p> “中國尚未公佈任何關於死刑的數字;但是，現有資料顯示，每年有數千人被處決並被判處死刑，”報告中寫道。 </p><p>國際特赦組織的報告還澄清了他們的許多數字在技術上是最低估計數，這就是使用“至少690次執行”之類的語言的原因。 </p><p></p>'),(111,3,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/politics/us-taiwan-military-training-deal/index.html','State Department approves renewal of $500 million Taiwan military training program','null','The State Department has approved a possible deal with Taiwan to renew a $500 million training program in the US for Taiwanese F-16 pilots and maintenance crews.','By Ryan Browne, CNN','2019-04-15T23:04:00Z',1555369440000,'<p>Washington (CNN)The State Department has approved a possible deal with Taiwan to renew a $500 million training program in the US for Taiwanese F-16 pilots and maintenance crews. </p><p>The proposed sale is bound to irritate Beijing, which has long protested US arms sales to Taiwan.</p><p>\"Today\'s notification is consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our support for Taiwan\'s ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,\" a US State Department official told CNN. </p><p>The training program is based at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and goes back several years. </p><p>The $500 million package covers the costs associated with the program including flight training, participation in approved training exercises, training munitions, supply and maintenance support, and spare and repair parts.</p><p>The proposed sale is unrelated to Taiwan\'s reported plans to purchase new F-16 fighter jets from the US, according to the State Department official.</p><p>Taiwan accused China of \"reckless and provocative\" action after two Chinese air force jets crossed a maritime border separating the island from the mainland on March 31.</p><p>The island\'s military scrambled fighter planes after it said two Chinese J-11 fighter jets crossed the border within the waters of the Taiwan Strait, known as the median line.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.</p><p> (CNN)Thirty years ago Monday, the most important Chinese mass movement of the last half-century began when Beijing students gathered to mourn Hu Yaobang, a reformist official.</p><p>Soon, massive crowds calling for change were converging on the central plazas of dozens of Chinese cities. On May 20, the government imposed martial law in Beijing, whose Tiananmen Square was the site of the largest rallies. Two weeks later, on June 4, the movement ended after soldiers fired on unarmed civilians on the streets of the capital. </p><p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has ruled the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) since its founding in 1949, has never allowed an official investigation into the killing. The massacre\'s death toll remains unknown, but at least several hundred civilians and perhaps ten times that were slain. </p><p>Thanks in part to the iconic photo of the \"Tank Man\" standing up to the armed might of the CCP, June 4 is famous around the world, but discussion of what happened on 6/4 -- known as liusi in Chinese -- remains heavily censored in China and public mourning of the victims is forbidden. </p><p>This concerted effort to blot out memory of a 30-year-old event is not unprecedented, and there are parallels in the handling of an earlier massacre across the Taiwan strait. This one, known as 2/28, took place in 1947 in Taipei, the largest city and capital of Taiwan, which is officially known as the Republic of China (ROC).</p><p>For decades, the Nationalist Party (KMT) whose soldiers carried out the 2/28 massacre prevented official investigation of the bloodshed. The size of the death toll thus remains uncertain, though it is believed to be between several thousand and 25,000. </p><p>In 1977, 30 years after 2/28, the KMT continued to ban all discussion of the event. </p><p>Two governments, two massacres </p><p>In 1977, Taiwan was still, like today\'s PRC, under one-party authoritarian rule. </p><p>A key reason the memories of the 1947 massacre threatened the KMT in 1977 and memories of the 1989 massacre threaten the CCP now is that, in each killing, soldiers touted as benevolent defenders of the people behaved like brutal invaders. </p><p>Today however, Taiwan is a democracy, and 2/28 is marked nationwide as Peace Memorial Day. What can we learn from the similarities between the massacres -- and that the KMT eventually apologized for 2/28? </p><p>After Japan\'s 1945 surrender in World War II, Chiang Kai-shek\'s forces seized Taiwan and claimed it for the ROC, which then included much of the territory of today\'s PRC. Heavy-handed efforts to subdue the island by Chiang\'s KMT were, not surprisingly, met with resistance. Tensions flared on February 27, 1947, when police struck a widow who was selling cigarettes illegally. Big protests broke out. The next day KMT soldiers fired on crowds. </p><p>Chiang\'s government denied that a massacre had occurred and stuck to this position long after Mao Zedong\'s forces drove the KMT from the Chinese mainland.</p><p>On the 30th anniversary of the massacre, a public reckoning with the event seemed no more likely than a full investigation into Tiananmen does today. But that changed. </p><p>Taiwan\'s past, China\'s future</p><p>Even though only one of the massacres can be openly discussed in the place in which it occurred, there are three ways in which thinking about 2/28\'s legacy helps put that of 6/4 into perspective.</p><p>First, by showing that the histories of authoritarian systems often take unexpected turns.</p><p>Hopes for a long-term relaxation of repression in the PRC have proved chimerical. The CCP has been remarkably resilient. But Taiwan\'s case reminds us that even resilient objects break. </p><p>The ROC was under martial law for decades. As late as 1979, the KMT used force to crush pro-democracy protesters in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\'s second biggest city. In the 1980s, however, democracy activists asserted themselves with a vigor that took many observers by surprise, and, in 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek\'s son and successor, unexpectedly reversed his father\'s policies and allowed for formal establishment of an opposition party. Martial law eventually ended in 1987.</p><p>Second, multiple forces can drive change. </p><p>Political activists, long-time officials, and other actors played important roles in Taiwan\'s democratization. This suggests the need to avoid letting PRC President Xi Jinping\'s current emphasis on control engender myopia. Even when a confident strongman is on top, it is worth keeping an eye out for forces bubbling under the surface.</p><p>Third, change is a long slog. </p><p>It\'s worth remembering that the ROC did not have its first direct presidential election until 1996.  And its first non-KMT President was not elected until 2000.</p><p>Taiwan\'s history does not tell us what will happen in the PRC in the near future, but it does give us reason to hope that policies -- including how 6/4 is remembered and discussed -- can eventually change. </p><p>The question that remains is how, and when? </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410130650-tiananmen-square-1989-64-banner-story-body.jpg','[\"304\", \"349\", \"260\"]',1,'在天安門大屠殺30年後，台灣為中國展示了另一條道路','null','儘管只有一個大屠殺可以在其發生的地方公開討論，但有三種方式可以考慮2/28的遺產有助於將6/4的大屠殺納入其中。','<p> Margaret K.

Since she took power in 2016, Tsai has attempted to diversify the island\'s economy from being too dependent on its large neighbor, while pushing back against what she views as Beijing\'s aggressive expansionism. </p><p>In turn, Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan, conducting large scale military drills around the island, including sailing the Liaoning aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.

I will definitely respect and follow Mazu\'s will.\"</p><p>Speaking later at KMT headquarters -- still wearing his cap -- Gou said he was \"willing to participate in the primary elections.\"</p><p>\"I am not willing to accept being appointed (without being elected), I am definitely not willing to accept being appointed.

According to multiple media reports, the Foxconn chairman is rumored to have been inspired by Trump\'s 2016 run and began thinking that he too could be President. </p><p>Margaret Lewis, a Taiwan expert at the Seton Hall University School of Law, compared Gou\'s candidacy to Trump\'s, and warned against underestimating the Taiwanese billionaire. </p><p>\"Even though he\'s obviously flawed in many ways as a candidate, populism can be powerful,\" she said. \"It would be a mistake to treat his run too lightly.\" </p><p>While Gou is definitely an outsider candidate -- according to state media, he hasn\'t been a KMT member since 2000 -- he\'s received backing from key party figures, with former leader and President of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, saying he was \"an ideal candidate.\" </p><p>Lev Nachman, an expert on Taiwanese politics at the University of California, Irvine, said that Gou had one thing in particular that the KMT needs: Funding. </p><p>\"Terry Gou is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Taiwan and would essentially be able to finance his own campaign,\" he said. \"That\'s a big deal for the KMT right now.\"</p><p> </p><p>Support from Beijing?</p><p>Despite once fighting a civil war with the Communist Party for rule over China -- before defeat forced the Republic of China government to retreat to Taiwan -- the KMT has in recent decades been the party of closer ties and engagement with Beijing. </p><p>Former President Ma held historic talks with China\'s Xi in 2015, and his administration massively ramped up cross-straits economic activity, including a controversial trade deal that sparked mass protests known as the Sunflower Movement, which are credited with helping carry Tsai and her DPP to the presidency. </p><p>Gou\'s connections to China are manifold. His company Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people in factories and manufacturing plants across China. </p><p>\"Gou is an integral player in the Chinese economy and becoming president would put him in a position to very closely tie Taiwan into China\'s economy in ways Tsai has fought against such as her New Southbound Policy which tried to extend Taiwan\'s trade beyond just China,\" Nachman said. </p><p>Foxconn could also be a potential concern for voters, however. </p><p>So far, the company has been tight-lipped over what a Gou run for president will exactly mean for his relations with the company he founded. </p><p>A spokeswoman said that at present Gou remains chairman, and would \"continue to provide strategic direction and guidance,\" as he seeks the KMT nomination. </p><p>\"That\'s the million dollar question. Who is Gou loyal to? Taiwan? Foxconn? Both? If the answer is Foxconn or both, that puts Taiwan in a bad position with Gou as president because Foxconn\'s success is tied to, coercively or not, the Chinese state,\" Nachman said. </p><p>\"In the same way Trump only marginally divested from his assets when he became president, I would not expect Gou to truly move away from his (company),\" he added. </p><p>\"I would be greatly concerned with Gou\'s ability to separate his business from his political endeavors. Given Foxconn\'s position within the Chinese economy and Gou\'s political ideals, I\'m not sure he even can or wants to.\"</p><p>Lewis, the Seton Hall professor, also cautioned against assuming that Gou -- or any other KMT President -- would be able to magically fix relations with Beijing. </p><p>\"Ma Ying-jeou met with Xi Jinping, but I don\'t think it\'s fair to compare the Xi Jinping of 2013 with the Xi Jinping of 2019,\" she said. \"He\'s been able to take on a more assertive position in recent years.\" </p><p>Can he win? </p><p>Gou has said repeatedly that he does not want to be simply anointed as KMT candidate, and will fight the party\'s primary. </p><p>This could be a close run for the billionaire, with multiple other candidates and potential candidates, including Han Kuo-yu, who Gou himself previously said would be a \"terrific\" president. </p><p>Han, a hugely popular KMT mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, has not officially announced his candidacy, but had been seen in recent weeks as frontrunner to be the party\'s eventual pick. He recently toured the US, meeting with lawmakers and business leaders, a traditional first step to declaring a run for president. </p><p>\"Han Kuo-yu is a very interesting, unusual person,\" Lewis said. \"He has has not set forth clear policies, going with a much more flashy, \'I\'m something different even if you don\'t know what that is\' approach.\" </p><p>As Kaohsiung mayor, Han has increased engagement with China, and would be expected to follow a similar path to Gou\'s, which Lewis described as a \"general willingness to engage with China, particularly economically, and a belief that that engagement can be confined to the economic.\" </p><p>\"Han does currently have an unmatched level of popularity in Taiwan right now,\" Nachman said. \"Han has also shown, especially during his most recent trip to Hong Kong, that he, like Gou, is willing to build strong connections to the CCP and push for a more pro-unification agenda.\" </p><p>With both Gou and Han favoring closer ties with China, Nachman said there was even a small possibility they could end up working together, on a ticket that could dramatically reshape politics both within the KMT and Taiwan at large. </p><p>\"That would be the most blatantly pro-unification team to ever be seriously considered for presidential leadership,\" he said. \"It could very much lead to the end of the current status quo as we know it.\" </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190417234154-0417-terry-gou-02-story-body.jpg','[\"328\", \"316\", \"312\"]',23,'一位女神激勵台灣億萬富翁效仿特朗普的榜樣','null','“郭台銘是中國經濟中不可或缺的一員，成為總統將使他能夠以Tsai所反對的方式將台灣與中國經濟緊密聯繫在一起，例如她的新南行政策試圖將台灣的貿易擴展到中國之外，”納赫曼說。','<p> （美國有線電視新聞網）台灣最富有的人，其公司以在中國製造iPhone而聞名，他已經投入到島上即將舉行的總統競選中。 </p><p>據國家媒體報導，電子製造業巨頭富士康董事長郭台銘週三表示，海神女神媽祖告訴他“向台灣人民挺身而出”。 </p><p>據該公司稱，如果他贏得初選，被選為國民黨總統候選人，那麼估計淨資產為80億美元的郭台銘將在富士康（Fox Hain）“退出日常運營”，如果他贏得初選。 </p><p>富士康是全球最大的電子產品製造商，為Apple，華為等提供配件。這家台灣公司在中國擁有龐大的業務，在那裡僱傭了數十萬人，並於2017年承諾在威斯康星州建立一家工廠，以換取40億美元的州和地方稅收優惠政策。 </p><p>如果被選中，郭台銘可能會在1月11日舉行的2020年大選中面對現任台灣總統蔡英文。 </p><p> Tsai宣布她打算在今年2月舉行，因為在2018年地方選舉失敗後，她的民主進步黨（DPP）在全島範圍內大肆流行。 </p><p>民進黨傳統上贊成將台灣事實上的獨立從中國正式化的舉措。自從她在2016年掌權以來，Tsai一直試圖使該島的經濟多樣化，使其過於依賴其大鄰居，同時又反對她所認為的北京侵略性擴張主義。 </p><p>反過來，北京加大了對台灣的壓力，在島上進行大規模軍事演習，包括在遼寧航空公司通過台灣海峽航行。中國國家主席習近平在1月份發表講話，敦促台灣接受與中國的“和平統一”，稱獨立是“死胡同”。 </p><p>如果他成為總統，郭台銘可能會受到修復這種關係的挑戰，同時保持台灣與華盛頓的傳統強關係。 </p><p>由於能夠做到這一點，他將比許多候選人有更好的要求 -

She is well-liked abroad for her reluctance to pick fights with China. But she is not popular at home. Recent polls put her approval rating below 30%. Her bid for re-election next year, already iffy, just got iffier. Lai Ching-te, her former prime minister, has declared that he will challenge Ms Tsai for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). It is the first time an incumbent president in Taiwan has been subjected to a primary. And the contest may anger China, since Mr Lai is a more vocal supporter than Ms Tsai of the idea that Taiwan should formally declare itself to be a distinct country from China—a move China says would be grounds for war.  </p><p>“Taiwan doesn’t want to be a second Hong Kong or Tibet,” declared Mr Lai as he registered for the primary this week, insinuating that Ms Tsai is not doing enough to ensure Taiwan’s independence. The DPP was thrashed in municipal elections in November by the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, which advocates warmer relations with China. Voters seemed disappointed that Ms Tsai’s efforts to stimulate the economy have had scant success. Growth is slowing. Wages have been stagnant for decades.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Following the defeat in November, Ms Tsai stepped down as leader of the DPP. A month later Mr Lai, a former mayor of the southern city of Tainan, resigned as prime minister, spurning Ms Tsai’s entreaties for him to stay. The primary will involve the two candidates giving televised presentations of their platforms, after which the party conducts an opinion poll of a sample of the whole electorate. The more popular candidate wins the nomination. The results will be announced on April 17th.</p><p>DPP activists had been panicking, as Ms Tsai has been trailing badly in the polls. They feared not only a further electoral setback, but one that would have put the government into the hands of a China-friendly leader just as China is pressing Taiwan to begin talks on unification. Some advocates of independence, fed up with Ms Tsai’s caution, are jubilant at Mr Lai’s announcement, both because they think Mr Lai has a better chance of winning and because they think he might be more assertive.</p><p>Ms Tsai’s supporters, meanwhile, are arguing that the primary could split the party and are making agonised calls for unity, by which they seem to mean Mr Lai’s withdrawal. Chen Chi-mai, the deputy prime minister and a supporter of Ms Tsai, argued in a Facebook post that China’s growing assertiveness makes divisions within the party especially dangerous. “The 2020 election will determine whether Taiwan survives or is extinguished,” he said. </p><p>Luckily for the DPP, the KMT also has no anointed candidate and its primary is still some months away. A former mayor of New Taipei City, Eric Chu, and a former speaker of parliament, Wang Jin-pyng, have both said they will run. The election will probably also feature an independent candidate, Ko Wen-je, the popular mayor of Taipei.  </p><p> Inevitably, China will be front and centre in the campaign. The authorities across the Taiwan Strait probably revile Mr Lai even more than they do Ms Tsai. That might encourage them to ease the pressure on Taiwan a bit over the next few months. The Chinese government knows from experience that attempts to intimidate Taiwanese voters tend to backfire, prompting them to back the candidate most hostile to its cherished goal of reunification.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250687929','[\"114\", \"325\", \"126\"]',1,'台灣總統蔡英文受到前任下屬的挑戰','沒有任何一位尋求連任的人不得不在此之前與小學打架','這場比賽可能會激怒中國，因為賴先生比蔡女士更有聲稱支持台灣應該正式宣布自己是一個與中國截然不同的國家 - 中國認為這將成為戰爭的理由。','<p>作為台灣第一位女總統，蔡英文是開拓者。由於不願意與中國打架，她在國外很受歡迎。但她在家裡並不受歡迎。最近的民意調查顯示，她的支持率低於30％。她競選明年的連任，已經是不確定的，只是變得更加有效。她的前總理賴清德宣布，他將向蔡女士挑戰民主進步黨（DPP）的總統候選人提名。這是台灣現任總統第一次受到初選。這場比賽可能會激怒中國，因為賴先生比蔡女士更有聲稱支持台灣應該正式宣布自己是一個與中國截然不同的國家 - 中國認為這將成為戰爭的理由。 </p><p> “台灣不希望成為第二個香港或西藏，”黎先生在本週註冊小學時表示，暗示蔡女士在確保台灣獨立方面做得不夠。民進黨在11月的市政選舉中遭到國民黨（國民黨）的抨擊，國民黨是主要的反對黨，主張與中國建立更溫暖的關係。選民似乎對蔡英文刺激經濟的努力取得的成功感到失望。增長正在放緩。幾十年來，工資一直停滯不前。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>在11月失敗後，蔡女士辭去民進黨領導職務。一個月後，南方城市台南的前市長賴先生辭去總理職務，摒棄蔡女士的懇求，讓他留下來。初選將涉及兩名候選人提供他們平台的電視轉播，之後該黨對整個選民的樣本進行民意調查。更受歡迎的候選人贏得了提名。結果將於4月17日公佈。 </p><p>民進黨的積極分子一直在恐慌，因為蔡女士在民意調查中的表現非常糟糕。他們不僅擔心會受到進一步的選舉挫折，而且還會讓政府落入中國友好領導人的手中，正如中國迫使台灣開始統一談判一樣。一些支持蔡女士謹慎行為的獨立倡導者對賴先生的宣布感到高興，因為他們認為賴先生有更好的獲勝機會，因為他們認為他可能更加自信。 </p><p>與此同時，蔡女士的支持者們認為，主要人士可能會分裂黨派，並且正在激動地呼籲團結，這似乎意味著賴先生的退出。副總理兼蔡女士的支持者陳志邁在一篇Facebook帖子中指出，中國日益增強的自信心使得黨內的分歧特別危險。他說：“2020年的選舉將決定台灣是否存活或被淘汰。” </p><p>對於民進黨來說幸運的是，國民黨也沒有受膏的候選人，其主要任期還有幾個月之後。新台北市前市長Eric Chu和前議長王金平都表示會參選。這次選舉可能還會有一位獨立候選人，即台北的市長Ko Wen-je。 </p><p>中國將不可避免地成為這場運動的前沿和中心。台灣海峽當局可能比對蔡女士更加辱罵賴先生。這可能會鼓勵他們在未來幾個月內緩解對台灣的壓力。中國政府從經驗中了解到，企圖恐嚇台灣選民的做法往往會適得其反，促使他們支持對其珍視的統一目標最敵視的候選人。 </p>'),(115,4,'https://www.economist.com/china/2019/02/09/does-china-understand-taiwan','Does China understand Taiwan?','Ostracism of pro-independence Taiwanese is dangerous and counterproductive','She wants a career in China but still laments that Chinese classmates—reared on jingoistic schoolbooks and censored news—cannot comprehend why Taiwanese would vote for the DPP or resist unification, insisting that they must simply want to humiliate China.','','2019-02-09T00:00:00Z',1549670400000,'<p></p><p>IF CHINA’S RULERS ever decide to invade Taiwan—a grim but not impossible prospect—they will need good answers to two questions.

Their offer to the democratic island of 23m is ostensibly generous. Under the slogan “One Country, Two Systems”, Taiwan is promised lots of autonomy alongside access to China’s vast market. This is backed by honeyed words about unifying a family sundered for 70 years, since China’s civil war ended with the losing Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT) retreating to what they hoped would be temporary exile on Taiwan. Still, China is committed to using force to block any bid for formal independence.</p><p>Chinese optimists call time their ally, as Taiwan’s population ages and its economy slows. Chaguan visited Taiwan recently. It is true that China’s gleaming coastal cities make Taipei’s 1980s skyscrapers look shabby. But time is China’s foe too, says Freddy Lim, a heavy-metal rock star and legislator for Taiwan’s pro-independence New Power Party. Mr Lim cites polls showing that youngsters increasingly identify as Taiwanese and consider China another country, albeit one where they like to do business.</p><p>Put bluntly, China’s proposals sound creepy to many young, urban Taiwanese. In effect, they hear a demand to submit to marriage with a stern cousin, arranged decades ago: “I am rich now, let me cherish you—or I will kill you.”</p><p>Taiwanese defiance may anger China’s leaders. But they cannot safely ignore it. Any Chinese victory would need to be quick, with Taiwan’s will to fight broken so swiftly that calls for an American rescue become moot. Taiwanese security experts are frank about what they fear: a psychological collapse among the public, for instance after initial waves of Chinese missiles wreck more than half the island’s defences, or blow up oil and gas terminals to cut power supplies. Then there is the question of what happens the day after China wins. Politicians predict mass protests in Taiwanese cities. Would China send tanks to subdue its sullen new satrapy?</p><p>Alas, China has closed off avenues to answering such questions. Communist bosses growl that they will only engage with Taiwanese who agree that their island is part of China. That excludes President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The DPP says that the island they govern is a country in its own right, though to avoid a crisis they fudge what they mean by that. In their desire to teach Taiwanese voters that DPP rule brings pain and isolation, China has sought to ostracise the party since Ms Tsai won election in 2016. Government-to-government contacts have been limited to such technical subjects as air-traffic control, food safety and some police co-operation, for instance when one side seeks the return of a fleeing murderer. Chinese pressure is blamed for sharp declines in tourism from the mainland and in short-term exchanges by mainland students, though about 3,500 Chinese students remain in Taiwan on degree courses. Even scholars close to the DPP have been blacklisted from travel to China, among them Tseng Chien-yuan of Chung Hua University. He adds that Chinese academics he has known for decades are now barred from formal contacts with him. “I worry about this situation, because if the Chinese government only hears what it wants to know, they can never understand Taiwan,” says Mr Tseng.</p><p>China does hear from conservative supporters of the KMT, which backs closer ties with China, although not unification. About 370,000 mainlanders married to Taiwanese live on the island. Those who vote lean KMT. Equally, at any moment there are a million Taiwanese in China, including 400,000 long-term residents. Tales abound of Chinese officials offering economic rewards to Taiwanese businessmen who endorse unification.</p><p>Wang Ting-yu, a DPP legislator who sits on the parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committees, says that China’s intelligence services gather information about Taiwan from “between 10,000 and 100,000” agents and informers. Fewer than 5,000 are professional spies, he estimates. Chinese informers might be Taiwanese gangsters on the hustle in southern China, or Taiwanese businessmen looking for favours. Mr Wang cautions that China may not learn much from its spies. (Taiwan’s spooks are underwhelming when he asks about China, he notes, either because they do not trust parliamentarians or because “they don’t know anything”.)</p><p>A big danger is that ignorance leads to impatience. There are over 140 students from both sides of the straits at the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies at the University of Xiamen, a handsome port city with close geographic and cultural links to Taiwan. Chen Xiancai, a professor at the institute, says many arrive knowing little about the other side. Mainland students point to China’s strength and ask: “Why haven’t we unified yet?” His Taiwanese students retort: “Why are you in such a hurry?” The institute’s scholars stand out for their professionalism, visiting Taiwan often to conduct fieldwork. The professor leads a DPP study centre opened within the institute in 2017. But he is cautious about describing its work, saying it is focused on building a database of academic papers. Still, he is sometimes berated by online nationalists, who complain that the DPP should be “exterminated”, not studied.</p><p>Sherry Yu, a Taiwanese student in Xiamen, comes from a family that votes for the KMT.

In April its civil aviation administration, CAAC, sent a letter to 44 of them, demanding that they specify Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as being parts of China when including them in drop-down menus of countries on booking websites. Fair enough for Hong Kong and Macau, which are universally recognised as being Chinese territories. But CAAC wants Taiwan to be called “Taiwan, China”, and maps to use the same colour for both the island and the People’s Republic. That is a problem. The island calls itself an independent, sovereign state.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Originally CAAC ordered the companies to comply by May 25th. However, by that date only 18 airlines had done so, despite the authority’s hint that violators would face punishment, including fines or action against their websites. Officials extended the deadline to July 25th, saying that some airlines were experiencing “technical difficulties” updating their lists. Among those that have fallen in line are Air Canada, Air France, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. Among the latest companies to do so is Air India, which this week began calling Taiwan “Chinese Taipei”, a term acceptable to China but viewed with disdain in Taiwan, which uses it only when access to international events requires it. Holdouts include the American carriers Delta, United and American Airlines, as well as a handful of Asian ones.</p><p>China’s spat with the airlines coincides with its stepped-up efforts to put pressure on the island itself. In the past year the Chinese armed forces have staged a growing number of exercises near Taiwan, including the flying of bombers and other aircraft around it. In May it deprived Taiwan of two members of its tiny band of diplomatic partners by establishing relations with Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic (China does not allow countries to have formal ties with Taiwan and China at the same time). Apart from wanting to signal displeasure with Taiwan, which has been led since 2016 by a party whose members scorn the idea of eventual reunification, China wants to warn America’s president, Donald Trump, that he should not get too friendly with the island.</p><p>Both America and Taiwan have bristled at China’s attempt to strong-arm the airlines. The White House called it “Orwellian nonsense”. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, says it represents “a new level of hysteria” in China’s approach to how others describe Taiwan. In theory, the island should have no objection to being called “Taiwan, China”. Its official name is the Republic of China and Taiwan is technically a province of that. But it worries that the word China is usually understood to mean the Communist-ruled entity that lays claim to Taiwan. “In essence, Taiwan is a country itself,” says Mr Wu. Informally, that is the name its officials give it.</p><p>China is digging in its heels. According to Reuters, it has refused an American government request for talks about the problem. Chinese leaders may be mindful of their image at home. In the cases involving Marriott, Gap and several of the airlines, it was Chinese netizens who sounded the alarm about the firms’ categorisations of Taiwan. Chinese social media blazed with rage as nationalists excoriated the companies. Under such pressure, the government had to take action, says Xin Qiang of Fudan University in Shanghai. Mr Xin says that, as Chinese officials see it, the risk of a domestic backlash for not acting toughly outweighs that of economic or diplomatic damage resulting from feuds with other countries. Most international airlines are likely to take the route of least resistance.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250687404','[\"397\", \"74\", \"147\"]',1,'中國與台灣外國公司的戰鬥迫在眉睫','大多數航空公司都會採取簡單的路線，停止將台灣稱為一個國家','4月，民航局民航局向其中44人發出了一封信，要求他們將台灣，香港和澳門列為中國的一部分，並將其列入預訂網站上的國家下拉菜單。','<p>在主張台灣主權時，中國官員的鬥爭不會太小。 1月份，審查員關閉了連鎖酒店萬豪酒店的網站，此前該公司在台灣以及西藏，香港和澳門作為客戶調查的國家。該公司首席執行官發佈公開道歉後，該網站才暢通無阻。今年4月，中國抱怨在線布述台灣作為一個國家，由布克獎小說組織者組織（他們最終選擇了一個軟糖，將島嶼列為“國家/地區”）。 Gap是一家時裝零售商，5月份因為銷售一件帶有中國地圖而不包括台灣的T卹而受到抨擊。該公司通過撤回產品並承諾“嚴格審查”作出回應。 </p><p>中國仍在與國際航空公司展開激烈競爭。 4月，民航局民航局向其中44人發出了一封信，要求他們將台灣，香港和澳門列為中國的一部分，並將其列入預訂網站上的國家下拉菜單。對香港和澳門來說足夠公平，這是公認的中國領土。但民航局希望將台灣稱為“台灣，中國”，並將地圖用於島嶼和人民共和國。這是一個問題。該島稱自己是一個獨立的主權國家。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>最初CAAC要求公司在5月25日前遵守規定。然而，截至該日期，只有18家航空公司已經這樣做了，儘管當局暗示違規者將面臨懲罰，包括對其網站的罰款或訴訟。官員們將截止日期延長至7月25日，稱一些航空公司正在經歷“技術難題”更新其名單。排隊的有加拿大航空公司，法國航空公司，德國漢莎航空公司和新加坡航空公司。最近這樣做的公司是印度航空公司，它本週開始稱台灣為“中國台北”，這個詞在中國是可以接受的，但在台灣卻不屑一顧，台灣僅在獲得國際活動時才使用它。堅持包括美國航空公司達美航空，美聯航和美國航空公司以及少數亞洲航空公司。 </p><p>中國與航空公司的爭執恰逢其加大力度對該島本身施加壓力。在過去的一年裡，中國武裝部隊在台灣附近舉行了越來越多的演習，包括在其周圍飛行轟炸機和其他飛機。 5月，通過與布基納法索和多米尼加共和國建立關係，中國剝奪了台灣兩個外交夥伴小組成員（中國不允許各國同時與台灣和中國建立正式關係）。除了想要表達對台灣的不滿之外，台灣自2016年以來一直由一個成員蔑視最終統一的政黨領導，中國希望警告美國總統唐納德特朗普，他不應該對島嶼過於友好。 </p><p>美國和台灣都對中國試圖強化航空公司的企圖感到憤怒。白宮稱之為“奧威爾式的廢話”。台灣外交大臣約瑟夫·吳（Joseph Wu）表示，在中國如何形容台灣方面，這代表了“一種新的歇斯底里”。理論上，島嶼不應該反對被稱為“中國台灣”。它的正式名稱是中華民國，台灣在技術上是一個省。但它擔心中國這個詞通常被理解為是指共產黨統治的實體，它聲稱對台灣有所要求。 “實質上，台灣本身就是一個國家，”吳先生說。非正式地說，這就是官員給它的名字。 </p><p>中國正在緊跟其後。據路透社報導，它已拒絕美國政府要求就此問題進行談判。中國領導人可能會留意他們在國內的形象。在涉及萬豪，加普和幾家航空公司的案件中，中國網民對這些公司對台灣的分類大加警惕。隨著民族主義者對這些公司的譴責，中國的社交媒體風靡一時。上海復旦大學的新強說，在這種壓力下，政府不得不採取行動。辛先生表示，正如中國官員所看到的那樣，國內強烈反對的風險超過了因與其他國家的不和而造成的經濟或外交損害。大多數國際航空公司都可能採取阻力最小的航線。 </p>'),(117,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/01/the-legalisation-of-gay-marriage-meets-resistance-in-taiwan','The legalisation of gay marriage meets resistance in Taiwan','Voters face a series of confusing referendums on the subject in late November','As in America, says Evan Wolfson, who has campaigned for marriage equality in several countries, it is likely to prove a step towards allowing same-sex couples from Hong Kong to marry.','','2018-11-01T16:40:21Z',1541090421000,'<p></p><p>NOWHERE IN ASIA celebrates gay pride as flamboyantly as Taipei. The annual parade in Taiwan’s capital draws tens of thousands, many from overseas. If you think near-naked men in diamanté tiaras and white go-go boots are normal for Asia—not to mention horned devils marching next to real Christian pastors—think again. Only in September did India legalise gay sex. In mainland China gay people are still often regarded as deviants. In Afghanistan sex between men is punishable by death.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Some 25 countries around the world allow same-sex marriage—but none of them is in Asia, unless you count Australia and New Zealand. Last year, however, Taipei’s parade-goers really had something to celebrate. Taiwan’s highest court had recently ruled that barring same-sex couples from marrying violated the right to be treated equally. It gave the government of President Tsai Ing-wen two years to write same-sex marriage into law.</p><p>At this year’s parade, on October 27th, the flamboyance could not conceal mounting worries. Since the court ruling, Ms Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have dithered over the needed legal changes. Ms Tsai was once outspoken in favour of marriage equality, which recommended her to younger voters. But she has since found the issue to be more polarising than she expected—and Taiwanese society has plenty of divisions already. Besides, municipal elections loom on November 24th. They will be a test of Ms Tsai’s leadership, and the DPP wants to avoid controversy. Its traditional base in the island’s south is older and more conservative, except in wanting Taiwan to declare a formal separation from China.</p><p>Anti-gay forces have seized their chance. A law passed by the DPP makes it easier to get referendums onto the ballot: voters face no fewer than ten questions on November 24th. One asks whether discussion of LGBT matters should be banned in primary and middle schools. It is intended to roll back those parts of the national curriculum that teach respect and understanding for gay students. The second asks whether voters think the civil code should define marriage as between a man and a woman. A third asks whether the rights of same-sex couples to form a permanent union should be guaranteed in a form other than civil marriage.</p><p>Gay activists have hit back with two referendums of their own—one asking whether the school curriculum should stipulate education on LGBT matters, and the other asking if same-sex rights should be enshrined in the civil code.</p><p>It is not clear how binding the results of the referendums are (they may also prove contradictory, which would be awkward). And the court has made clear that if the government does not legislate in time, same-sex couples may go ahead and marry anyway. But the conservatives’ aim is to change the climate, says Victoria Hsu of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights: teachers may grow nervous about talking about gay issues, for instance. Opponents of gay marriage would also like to get the government to institute a distinct form of marriage for gay couples, rather than amend existing marriage law. But for supporters of same-sex marriage, separate legislation for gays would be discriminatory. They liken it to America’s Jim Crow laws that once enforced racial segregation.</p><p>Other parts of Asia are watching Taiwan. Hong Kong has a vibrant civil society and growing openness to homosexuality. Since a court ruling in July the government recognises marriages of foreign same-sex couples conducted abroad for residency and other purposes. The move has the backing of businesses and law firms worried about Hong Kong’s ability to attract international talent. As in America, says Evan Wolfson, who has campaigned for marriage equality in several countries, it is likely to prove a step towards allowing same-sex couples from Hong Kong to marry.</p><p>After Hong Kong, Japan, the only G7 country that does not recognise same-sex unions, may be next. In September five foreign chambers of commerce called for marriage equality, backing calls from influential multinationals. One female lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party wrote this summer that LGBT couples were “unproductive” because they didn’t reproduce. But other ruling-party politicians are more open-minded. A growing number think the Olympic games, which Tokyo is hosting in 2020, could be a cue for Japan to come out in favour of marriage equality. That would put Japan itself on the podium.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250687281','[\"355\", \"312\", \"133\"]',27,'同性戀婚姻合法化遇到了台灣的抵抗','選民在11月底面臨一系列令人困惑的全民投票','正如美國一樣，曾在多個國家爭取婚姻平等的埃文·沃爾夫森說，這可能會證明朝著允許香港同性伴侶結婚的方向邁出了一步。','<p></p><p>無論在亞洲如何華麗都像台北一樣慶祝同性戀自豪感。台灣首都的年度遊行吸引了數万人，其中許多來自海外。如果你認為diamantétiaras和白色外套靴的近乎赤裸裸的男人對亞洲來說是正常的 - 更不用說在真正的基督教牧師旁邊行進的角魔 - 再想一想。印度只在9月才使同性戀合法化。在中國大陸，同性戀者仍然常被視為偏執者。在阿富汗，男性之間的性行為將受到死刑的懲罰。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>世界上大約25個國家允許同性婚姻 - 但除非你算上澳大利亞和新西蘭，否則它們都不在亞洲。然而，去年，台北的遊行隊員真的有些值得慶祝。台灣最高法院最近裁定，禁止同性伴侶結婚違反了平等對待的權利。它讓蔡英文總統的政府兩年來將同性婚姻寫成法律。 </p><p>在今年10月27日的遊行中，華麗無法掩飾令人擔憂的擔憂。自法院裁決以來，蔡女士和她的民進黨（DPP）對所需的法律變革猶豫不決。蔡女士曾一度直言不諱地支持婚姻平等，後者向年輕選民推薦她。但她後來發現問題比她預期的更加兩極分化 - 台灣社會已經有很多分歧。此外，市政選舉於11月24日臨近。他們將考驗蔡女士的領導，民進黨希望避免爭議。除了希望台灣宣布與中國正式分離外，它在該島南部的傳統基地更古老，更保守。 </p><p>反同性戀勢力抓住了機會。民進黨通過的一項法律使得公民投票更容易投票：選民在11月24日面臨至少十個問題。有人詢問是否應該在小學和中學禁止討論LGBT問題。它旨在回滾那些教導同性戀學生尊重和理解的國家課程。第二部分詢問選民是否認為民法應該將婚姻定義為男女之間。第三個問題是，同性伴侶組成永久性工會的權利是否應該以民事婚姻以外的形式得到保障。 </p><p>同性戀活動家們已經回擊了他們自己的兩次公民投票 - 一個問題是學校課程是否應該規定LGBT問題的教育，另一個詢問是否應該在民法典中規定同性權利。 </p><p>目前尚不清楚公民投票的結果是如何具有約束力的（它們也可能證明是矛盾的，這將是尷尬的）。法院已經明確表示，如果政府沒有及時立法，同性伴侶可能會繼續結婚。但保守黨的目標是改變氣候，台灣促進民事合作權利聯盟的Victoria Hsu說：例如，教師可能會因為談論同性戀問題而感到緊張。同性戀婚姻的反對者也希望讓政府為同性戀夫婦建立一種獨特的婚姻形式，而不是修改現有的婚姻法。但對於同性婚姻的支持者來說，對同性戀者的單獨立法將具有歧視性。他們把它比作曾經強制種族隔離的美國吉姆克勞法律。 </p><p>亞洲其他地區正在關注台灣。香港有一個充滿活力的公民社會和對同性戀的日益開放。自7月法院作出裁決以來，政府承認在國外進行居留和其他目的的外國同性伴侶的婚姻。此舉得到了企業和律師事務所的支持，他們擔心香港吸引國際人才的能力。正如美國一樣，曾在多個國家爭取婚姻平等的埃文·沃爾夫森說，這可能會證明朝著允許香港同性伴侶結婚的方向邁出了一步。 </p><p>在香港之後，日本是唯一一個不承認同性結合的G7國家。 9月，五個外國商會呼籲婚姻平等，支持有影響力的跨國公司的呼籲。執政的自由民主黨的一位女議員今年夏天寫道，LGBT夫婦因為沒有復製而“沒有生產力”。但其他執政黨政客更加開放。越來越多的人認為東京在2020年舉辦的奧運會可能成為日本支持婚姻平等的一個線索。這將使日本自己登上領獎台。 </p>'),(118,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/06/14/china-fights-taiwan-on-airline-websites','China fights Taiwan on airline websites','Meanwhile, America reinforces its alliance with Taiwan with bricks and mortar','Yet to judge by how much Chinese officials have harangued American diplomats and congressmen about who was going to attend the ceremony in Taiwan’s capital, China appears to care every bit as much and perhaps more about America’s actions in Taiwan than about geopolitical rivalry on the Korean peninsula.','','2018-06-14T15:09:16Z',1528988956000,'<p>GIVEN all the hoopla of President Donald Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, the opening on the same day of a new American not-quite-an-embassy in Taipei was never going to hog the headlines. Yet to judge by how much Chinese officials have harangued American diplomats and congressmen about who was going to attend the ceremony in Taiwan’s capital, China appears to care every bit as much and perhaps more about America’s actions in Taiwan than about geopolitical rivalry on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>Since 1979, when America broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to open them with China, its “one-China policy” has been the bedrock of dealings with China. This means never referring to Taiwan as a country and always “acknowledging” that both China and Taiwan hold to the idea that there is but one China, even if the two sides disagree over the definition. The fudge has allowed America to enjoy close unofficial relations with Taiwan. China rarely appeared bothered by America’s unofficial representation in Taipei, known as the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). For a long time it was housed in a dingy former military building in an unprepossessing part of the city.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>The new building unveiled on June 12th, in contrast, is a design icon in the fancy district of Neihu. It cost $250m. It looks, smells and feels just like a formal embassy. Most of its nearly 500 staff are American diplomats, albeit on temporary leave from the State Department. It issues visas. The Trump administration has considered sending marines to guard it.</p><p>To China, which wants everyone to act as if Taiwan belongs to it, the new building is provocative. So, too, is a piece of legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act, passed unanimously by Congress and signed in March by Mr Trump, which encourages exchanges between American and Taiwanese officials. China has stressed that a high-level official at the opening would jeopardise talks on trade as well as co-operation over North Korea. China’s nightmare was the attendance of Mr Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton. He has called for America to “revisit” its one-China policy.</p><p>In the event, the administration kept the opening low-key, if only so as not to distract attention from the Singapore summit. The most senior American official present was Marie Royce, a mere assistant secretary of state (and also the spouse of a pro-Taiwan congressman). During the proceedings, America’s de facto ambassador, Kin Moy, bowed three times before a table laden with fruit and flowers and then lit incense. “I offer you this [building], a tangible symbol that the United States is here to stay,” Mr Moy told President Tsai Ing-wen and assembled guests. The AIT chairman, James Moriarty, described democratic Taiwan as a “model for the Indo-Pacific region” and promised continued American support for “Taiwan’s ability to defend itself”. Mr Trump has approved $1.4bn in arms sales.</p><p>China no doubt sees the building’s 99-year lease as yet another provocation. Xi Jinping, who recently awarded himself an unlimited lease on China’s presidency, insists that Taiwan’s return to the motherland cannot wait for ever. But whether China will pick a fight over Taiwan now is another matter. It is not clear that Mr Trump cares for the island, except as a pawn in trade negotiations with China. He is said to have criticised State Department speeches in support of Taiwan as complicating his dealings with Mr Xi. And he did not send Mr Bolton. Bonnie Glaser of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an American think-tank, reckons that China is getting less anxious.</p><p>Pressure only grows on Ms Tsai, however. China has put Taiwan in the doghouse since she came to office two years ago. Though she has gone out of her way not to antagonise, she will not acknowledge that Taiwan is part of China. And she has failed to condemn her prime minister, William Lai Ching-te, who has professed to be a “Taiwan independence worker”.</p><p>Official relations across the Taiwan Strait are frozen. China denies Taiwan a seat at international forums such as the World Health Organisation. It bullies international airlines and hotel groups into referring to the country as a mere region of China. In April it put on the biggest naval exercises ever carried out in the South China Sea, followed by live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait. Chinese bombers circle the island. Meanwhile, diplomatic allies peel off. In May the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso switched sides, leaving just 18 countries that recognise Taiwan.</p><p>And yet. The more China closes Taiwan’s diplomatic space, the more Ms Tsai’s creative use of unofficial diplomacy grows. Her “New Southbound Policy” attempts to forge deeper ties with South-East Asian neighbours and beyond, including those caught up in disputes with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea. (Taiwan also claims much of the sea, but is far less pushy about it.)</p><p>The scope of the policy is broad, ranging from promoting tourism to easing the plight of migrant workers to investing in manufacturing (Taiwan ranks well ahead of China in investment in Vietnam, for example). The emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region is bearing fruit. Merriden Varrall and Charlie Lyons Jones of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, say that Australia’s interest in the New Southbound Policy contrasts sharply with its wait-and-see approach to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Japan has signed a memorandum on search-and-rescue operations with Taiwan, bolstering its maritime security; intelligence-sharing may be formalised next.

Rather, they centred on disgruntlement with Tsai Ing-wen, the president, who had pushed through several controversial reforms since taking office in 2016, while dithering over some of her supporters’ most cherished causes. But the outcome, a crushing defeat for Ms Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which would like Taiwan to abjure its notional status as part of China and declare itself a distinct country, will have prompted delight on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which favours ever-closer ties with China, has been revived after a dismal performance in 2016. Ms Tsai’s hopes of re-election in 2020 are looking dimmer.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p> Before the election the DPP controlled 13 of Taiwan’s 22 counties and cities. Now the tables have been turned. The KMT will run 15 and the DPP just six. (An independent candidate appears to have won re-election as mayor of Taipei, the capital.) The DPP even lost control of its electoral stronghold, the southern city of Kaohsiung, which it had ruled for 20 years. The results seemed so calamitous that Ms Tsai felt obliged to resign as head of the DPP. Her popular prime minister also offered to resign, but she demurred. “I’m the one that needs to change,” she declared on Facebook on November 26th.</p><p>Lo Chih-cheng, a DPP lawmaker, argues that Ms Tsai took on too many reforms at once. “The president was quite idealistic, not realistic,” Mr Lo said. “She thought the more, the better.” She cut unsustainable public pensions dramatically, which alienated many civil servants. She froze and in many cases confiscated the KMT’s assets, on the grounds that it had acquired them unfairly as the governing party during nearly 40 years of authoritarian rule. She pushed through a law to phase out nuclear power by 2025, alarming industrialists who rely on cheap and stable electricity.</p><p>Moreover, Mr Lo adds, when grappling with polarising issues, Ms Tsai has sometimes angered both sides in a fruitless search for middle ground. She limited normal working hours, upsetting bosses who now have to pay more overtime, but also trimmed the number of public holidays, angering ordinary workers. She dithered about legalising gay marriage, which she had supported during her election campaign, leaving it to the courts to settle the matter. And although she enraged China by refusing to affirm that it and Taiwan are both parts of the same country, she has been careful to do nothing else to provoke it, to the ire of independence activists.</p><p>The GDP growth rate has risen during Ms Tsai’s tenure, from 1.4% in 2016 to a projected 2.7% this year. But that has not been enough to dispel a sense of economic stagnation, compounded by the abrupt contraction of tourism from China following Ms Tsai’s election. Young Taiwanese continue to emigrate to the mainland in search of greater opportunity, often lured by generous official grants. Roughly a tenth of the Taiwanese workforce now lives in China.</p><p>China makes no bones about supporting the KMT. It cut all official contact with the national government after Ms Tsai’s election, but maintained links with KMT-run cities. During the campaign it halted intimidating circular patrols around the island by its warships and military aircraft, since such shows of force tend to stir nationalist feelings among Taiwanese, boosting the DPP. The Taiwanese government accused China of spreading false rumours on social media to help the KMT. Areas where the KMT has prevailed, such as Kaohsiung, are expected to see an influx of Chinese tourists and a surge in exports of agricultural goods to China.</p><p>But Mr Lo argues that it would be a mistake to view the results as endorsement of closer ties with China. There was a referendum on the ballot that touched directly on cross-strait relations, asking whether the country should demand to be called Taiwan at the Olympics, instead of Chinese Taipei. The result was ambiguous: the proposal was rejected, but only after the Olympic authorities warned that it might lead to Taiwan’s exclusion from the Tokyo games in 2020. The DPP did not campaign in favour of the idea, which is just the sort of departure from the status quo that Ms Tsai has tried to avoid.</p><p>Moreover, the KMT is still in disarray. Its candidate in Kaohsiung, Han Kuo-yu, proved to have genuine star power. But he is an outsider, initially written off by the leadership as a no-hoper. The party has no obvious presidential candidate.</p><p> Some in the DPP even see a silver lining in the nine other referendum questions on the ballot, none of which went the party’s way. Voters approved several measures hostile to gay rights, making it tricky for the government to fulfil the supreme court’s injunction to legalise gay marriage. They also rejected Ms Tsai’s scheme to close Taiwan’s nuclear plants. But it is the DPP that champions the idea of direct democracy. The Chinese authorities, who would love one day to absorb Taiwan, must hate the precedent being set.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250688031','[\"321\", \"306\", \"253\"]',1,'受到中國的歡呼，台灣的反對派扼殺了執政黨','總統再次當選的機會看起來更加暗淡','但結果是，蔡英文的民進黨（DPP）慘遭失敗，希望台灣放棄其作為中國一部分的名義地位並宣布自己是一個獨特的國家，這將使台灣海峽的另一邊感到高興。','<p></p><p>在事情上，11月24日台灣的地方選舉與中國沒什麼關係。相反，他們集中在對總統蔡英文的不滿，他在2016年上任以來一直在推動幾項有爭議的改革，同時對她的一些支持者最為珍惜的事業猶豫不決。但結果是，蔡英文的民進黨（DPP）慘遭失敗，希望台灣放棄其作為中國一部分的名義地位並宣布自己是一個獨特的國家，這將使台灣海峽的另一邊感到高興。反對國民黨（國民黨）支持與中國的關係日益密切，在2016年表現慘淡之後，它已經復活。蔡女士在2020年連任的希望看起來更加暗淡。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>大選前，民進黨控制了台灣22個縣市中的13個。現在桌子已經翻過來了。國民黨將運行15，民進黨只運行6。 （一位獨立候選人似乎贏得了首都台北市市長的連任。）民進黨甚至失去了對其選舉據點 - 南方城市高雄的控制權，該城市已經統治了20年。結果似乎是災難性的，以至於蔡女士覺得有必要辭去民進黨領導的職務。她受歡迎的總理也提出辭職，但她表示反對。 “我是那個需要改變的人，”她於11月26日在Facebook上宣稱。 </p><p>民進黨議員羅志成認為蔡女士立即進行了太多改革。 “總統非常理想主義，不現實，”羅先生說。 “她認為越多越好。”她戲劇性地削減了不可持續的公共養老金，這使許多公務員疏遠了。她凍結並在許多情況下沒收了國民黨的資產，理由是它在近40年的獨裁統治期間不公平地獲得了他們作為執政黨。她推動了一項法律，到2025年逐步淘汰核電，令依賴廉價穩定電力的工業家們驚慌失措。 </p><p>此外，羅先生補充說，在解決兩極分化問題時，蔡女士有時會激怒雙方，尋找中間地帶。她限制了正常的工作時間，讓現在不得不支付更多加班費的老闆感到不安，同時也減少了公眾假期的數量，激怒了普通工人。她在同性戀婚姻合法化方面猶豫不決，她在競選期間一直支持同性婚姻，並將其交給法院解決此事。儘管她通過拒絕肯定中國和台灣都是同一個國家的一部分來激怒中國，但她一直小心翼翼地不做任何其他事情來挑起它，以及獨立活動家的憤怒。 </p><p>蔡女士任職期間的GDP增長率從2016年的1.4％上升到今年預計的2.7％。但這還不足以消除經濟停滯的感覺，再加上蔡女士當選後中國旅遊業的突然收縮。年輕的台灣人繼續移民到大陸尋找更多的機會，往往被慷慨的官方撥款所誘惑。目前台灣勞動力中約有十分之一生活在中國。 </p><p>中國不支持支持國民黨。在蔡女士當選後，它切斷了與國民政府的所有官方聯繫，但與國民黨運營的城市保持著聯繫。在競選期間，它通過戰艦和軍用飛機停止了對島嶼周圍巡邏的恐嚇，因為這種武力表現往往激起了台灣人的民族主義情緒，推動了民進黨。台灣政府指責中國在社交媒體上傳播虛假謠言以幫助國民黨。國民黨盛行的地區，如高雄，預計會有大量中國遊客湧入，中國農產品出口激增。 </p><p>但羅先生認為，將結果視為與中國建立更密切關係的做法是錯誤的。投票的公投直接觸及了兩岸關係，詢問該國是否應該要求在奧運會上被稱為台灣，而不是中國台北。結果是含糊不清的：該提案遭到拒絕，但只是在奧運會當局警告可能導致台灣在2020年被排除在東京奧運會之後。民進黨並沒有支持這一想法，這只是一種偏離蔡女士試圖避免的現狀。 </p><p>此外，國民黨仍處於混亂狀態。它在高雄的候選人韓國宇被證明擁有真正的明星力量。但他是一個局外人，最初由領導層作為一個沒有笨蛋的人。該黨沒有明顯的總統候選人。 </p><p>民進黨中的一些人甚至在投票中的其他九個公投問題上看到了一線希望，其中沒有一個是黨的方式。選民們批准了幾項對同性戀權利持敵對態度的措施，這使政府難以履行最高法院關於使同性婚姻合法化的禁令。他們還拒絕了蔡女士關閉台灣核電站的計劃。但正是民進黨捍衛了直接民主的理念。希望有一天能夠吸收台灣的中國當局必須討厭先例。 </p>'),(120,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/04/05/taiwan-is-again-becoming-a-flashpoint-between-china-and-america','Taiwan is again becoming a flashpoint between China and America','Unlike tensions over trade and North Korea, it involves red lines on both sides','China is not amused, although its increased diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan since Ms Tsai’s election two years ago has surely helped galvanise the American stance.','','2018-04-05T14:51:07Z',1522939867000,'<p>IF THE partisanship of American politics unsettles you, take heart from a little piece of legislation that sailed through both houses of Congress with not a single vote opposed to it. And though the Taiwan Travel Act could have passed into law without a presidential signature, last month Donald Trump chose to put his cardiogrammatic scrawl to it. Given the chaos in Washington, the act reveals a remarkable consensus. It urges, though it does not mandate, high-level visits between America and Taiwan of the kind that successive administrations have discouraged, so as not to offend China.</p><p>That country’s “one-China principle” decrees that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese motherland. The Chinese government wants all other countries to act as if Taiwan belongs to it. America has never agreed to the formulation since breaking off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to establish them with China. It has made plain that Taiwan is a friend, to which it has long offered military support. But, in deference to China, American policy has never been to call Taiwan a separate country and always to “acknowledge” that both China and Taiwan agree on the principle that there is only one China, even if the two sides disagree over what exactly that means.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>This is America’s “one-China policy”. The convenient untruth, whose side-effect has been to deepen Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation, was formulated when dictatorships in both Beijing and Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, claimed to rule all of China. Taiwan has no such pretensions today. Many members of Congress have long wished to give the island more credit for its peaceful transformation into a flourishing democracy over the past three decades. The Taiwan Travel Act was born out of this. It even gets close to calling a spade a spade, and Taiwan a sovereign country: “Visits to a country by United States Cabinet members and other high-ranking officials are an indicator of the breadth and depth of ties between the United States and such country,” one clause reads. This week President Tsai Ing-wen welcomed the act’s congressional sponsors in Taipei.</p><p>More surprising is Mr Trump’s support. It is true that as president-elect in late 2016 he took a congratulatory telephone call from Ms Tsai. That set off palpitations among Washington’s China-watchers. Yet Mr Trump soon reaffirmed the one-China policy. He told a host on his favourite television channel that he would do nothing over Taiwan without first consulting the Chinese ruler, Xi Jinping. And the relationship he has subsequently developed with Mr Xi has been larded with admiration for the dictator’s power and style. Nothing Mr Trump has said or done suggests a remotely similar admiration for Taiwan.</p><p>Yet a shift of sorts is under way. In January one pro-Taiwan China hawk, Randall Schriver, was put in charge of Asia-Pacific policy at the Pentagon. A more prominent hawk, John Bolton, is about to become Mr Trump’s national security adviser. And in March Alex Wong, the official in charge of Indo-Pacific strategy at the State Department, was in Taipei to deliver a speech. Taiwan, he said, “can no longer be excluded unjustly from international fora. [It] has much to share with the world.” With Taiwan barred from everything from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to Interpol, Mr Wong has a point. He assured Ms Tsai that American support for Taiwan has never been stronger.</p><p>China is not amused, although its increased diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan since Ms Tsai’s election two years ago has surely helped galvanise the American stance. Dignitaries visiting Beijing have been told that the sort of exchanges the travel act encourages could cross a red line, and that it is therefore more dangerous than two other big challenges facing Mr Xi. The first is the delicate summitry around a nuclear North Korea. The second is the growing American assault on Chinese exports and China-first industrial policies—on April 3rd the Trump administration announced 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods, from locomotives to snowblowers (see article).</p><p>The number two at the Chinese embassy in Washington, Li Kexin, warned Mr Trump not to sign the travel act. Last year he tried bullying Congress into watering down the National Defence Authorisation Act, which empowers (but again does not require) American naval vessels to call at Taiwanese ports. “The day that a US navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People’s Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force,” he thundered at a reception in December. Last month Mr Xi himself warned that any actions to “split China” would face “the punishment of history”. Such threats are having some effect in Taiwan. Even Ms Tsai’s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party is split over how much support to give the travel act. Ms Tsai herself is instinctively cautious about upsetting China. Few Taiwanese want their country to be a pawn in a great-power game.</p><p>A test comes in the summer, when America opens a gleaming building in Taipei to house its unofficial embassy, with rumours that a member of the cabinet may attend. Mr Bolton’s presence might genuinely alarm China. Alternatively, it might interpret the Trump administration’s steps over Taiwan as a mere prop to pressure on trade. Mr Xi’s top economics official, Liu He, is in intense negotiations over China’s gaping trade surplus with America. He is presumed to have Mr Xi’s authority to offer to cut the surplus by tens of billions of dollars to avert a fully fledged trade war.</p><p>But what if China sees America as continuing to change the status quo on Taiwan after that? A few years ago Mr Xi said that the Taiwan “problem” cannot be left to future generations. Now that he has seized all the levers of power, nationalists would judge him harshly if he did not use them to stop Taiwan slipping away. So the island is shooting up the security agenda again—a reminder of the flashpoint it does not want to be, but still is.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250688394','[\"397\", \"116\", \"222\"]',41,'台灣再次成為中美之間的爆發點','與貿易和朝鮮的緊張局勢不同，它涉及雙方的紅線','儘管兩年前蔡英文選舉以來台灣對台灣的外交和軍事壓力增大，但中國並沒有被逗樂，這無疑激發了美國的立場。','<p>如果美國政治的黨派關係使你感到不安，那麼請從國會兩院通過的一小部分立法中汲取靈感，而不是一票反對。雖然“台灣旅遊法案”可能在沒有總統簽名的情況下通過法律，但上個月唐納德·特朗普選擇將心電圖描繪成亂畫。鑑於華盛頓的混亂，該法案揭示了一個非凡的共識。它敦促，雖然它沒有強制要求，美國和台灣之間的高級別訪問是歷屆政府勸阻的，以免冒犯中國。 </p><p>這個國家的“一個中國原則”規定台灣是中國祖國不可分割的一部分。中國政府希望所有其他國家表現得好像台灣屬於它。自從1979年與台灣斷絕外交關係以便與中國建立外交關係以來，美國從未同意這一提法。很明顯台灣是一個朋友，長期以來一直提供軍事支持。但是，在尊重中國的情況下，美國的政策從來就沒有把台灣稱為一個單獨的國家，而且總是“承認”中國和台灣都同意只有一個中國的原則，即使雙方在這個問題上存在分歧。手段。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>這是美國的“一個中國政策”。當台灣首都北京和台北的獨裁統治統治全中國時，制定了方便的不真實，其副作用是加深台灣的外交孤立。台灣今天沒有這樣的自命不凡。許多國會議員長期以來一直希望在過去三十年中為和平轉變為繁榮的民主而給予該島更多的信譽。 “台灣旅行法”誕生於此之外。它甚至接近稱之為鐵鍬，台灣是一個主權國家：“美國內閣成員和其他高級官員對一個國家的訪問是美國與這個國家之間關係的廣度和深度的一個指標。 ，“一個條款讀到。本週，蔡英文總統對該法案在台北的國會贊助商表示歡迎。 </p><p>更令人驚訝的是特朗普先生的支持。確實，作為2016年末的當選總統，他接受了Tsai女士的祝賀電話。這引起了華盛頓中國觀察家們的心悸。但特朗普先生很快重申了一個中國的政策。他在最喜歡的電視頻道告訴主持人，如果沒有先諮詢中國統治者習近平，他就不會在台灣做任何事情。他隨後與習近平發展的關係一直是對獨裁者權力和風格的欽佩。特朗普先生所說或所做的一切都沒有表明對台灣的欽佩。 </p><p>然而，各種各樣的轉變正在進行中。今年1月，一位親台灣的中國鷹人蘭德爾施里弗負責五角大樓的亞太政策。更為突出的鷹派約翰博爾頓即將成為特朗普先生的國家安全顧問。三月份，國務院負責印度太平洋戰略的官員亞歷克斯·黃在台北發表演講。他說，台灣“再也不能被國際論壇不公正地排除在外。 [它]與世界有很多共同之處。“由於台灣禁止從國際民用航空組織到國際刑警組織等所有事項，黃先生有一個觀點。他向蔡女士保證，美國對台灣的支持從未如此強烈。 </p><p>儘管兩年前蔡英文選舉以來台灣對台灣的外交和軍事壓力增大，但中國並沒有被逗樂，這無疑激發了美國的立場。訪問北京的貴賓被告知，旅行法所鼓勵的那種交流可能會越過紅線，因此比習近平面臨的另外兩大挑戰更危險。首先是核朝鮮周圍的微妙峰會。第二是美國對中國出口和中國第一產業政策的攻擊日益增加 -  4月3日，特朗普政府宣布對500億美元的中國商品徵收25％的關稅，從機車到吹雪機（見文章）。 </p><p>中國駐華盛頓大使館李克新警告特朗普先生不要簽署旅行法案。去年，他試圖欺負國會，廢除國防授權法案，該法案授權（但同樣不要求）美國海軍艦艇在台灣港口停靠。 “美國海軍艦艇抵達高雄的那一天是我們人民解放軍用軍隊統一台灣的那一天，”他在12月的一次招待會上大聲疾呼。習近平上個月曾警告說，任何“分裂中國”的行動都將面臨“歷史的懲罰”。這些威脅在台灣產生了一些影響。甚至連蔡女士獨立傾向的民進黨也因為有多少支持來實施旅行法案而分歧。蔡女士本人對於擾亂中國本能地持謹慎態度。很少有台灣人希望他們的國家成為一個偉大的權力遊戲中的棋子。 </p><p>今年夏天，當美國在台北開設一座閃閃發光的大樓以容納其非官方大使館時，有一個測試，傳聞內閣成員可能會參加。博爾頓的存在可能會真正地警告中國。或者，它可能會解釋特朗普政府在台灣的步驟僅僅是對貿易壓力的支柱。習近平的最高經濟官員劉和正就中國與美國貿易順差的巨大談判展開激烈談判。據推測，習近平有權提出削減數百億美元的盈餘，以避免全面的貿易戰。 </p><p>但是，如果中國認為美國在此之後繼續改變台灣的現狀呢？幾年前，習近平表示台灣“問題”不能留給子孫後代。現在他抓住了所有的權力槓桿，民族主義者如果不用它們阻止台灣滑倒，就會嚴厲地評判他。所以島上再次提出安全議程 - 提醒它不想成為的閃點，但仍然如此。 </p>'),(121,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/05/26/taiwans-president-has-upset-both-business-and-workers','Taiwan’s president has upset both business and workers','When growth is slow, it is hard for Tsai Ing-wen to please anyone','At the same time, tension with China has grown, despite Ms Tsai’s efforts to restrain the more radical wing of the DPP, which wants to declare formal independence, rather than maintain the current fiction that the government of Taiwan notionally represents the whole of China.','','2018-05-26T00:00:00Z',1527292800000,'<p>LIKE a nervous candidate in a job interview, shy yet formal, she fielded questions ranging from how to handle Chinese infiltration to why she always wears trouser suits.

At the same time, tension with China has grown, despite Ms Tsai’s efforts to restrain the more radical wing of the DPP, which wants to declare formal independence, rather than maintain the current fiction that the government of Taiwan notionally represents the whole of China. Such a step, China has said, would be grounds for war.</p><p>Ms Tsai has tried to appeal both to business, in the hope of stimulating the economy, and to workers and environmentalists, the bedrock of the centre-left DPP. She has ended up pleasing neither. The DPP has promised to phase out nuclear power, but Ms Tsai allowed two shuttered reactors to restart after a big blackout last year, to the dismay of greens who object to nuclear energy despite its minimal greenhouse-gas emissions. In the name of workers’ rights, she issued new rules on working hours, which companies denounced as unduly rigid. When she modified them somewhat, unions howled.</p><p>Wages are barely higher than 15 years ago (see chart), largely because of increasing competition from manufacturers in China and elsewhere, which has left Taiwanese employers with little leeway to increase salaries. Many frustrated young university graduates have left the country in search of better opportunities. Ms Tsai has raised the monthly minimum wage by 10%, to NT$22,000 ($733). This year she also increased civil servants’ pay by 3%. Yet on May 1st thousands of workers took to the streets, waving banners reading “Fight for a higher salary”.</p><p>Taiwan has one of the lowest levels of foreign investment in Asia, points out William Foreman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. Ms Tsai’s government has given tax breaks to angel investors. She has also tried to pare regulation, giving firms more leeway to experiment with financial services, for example. And she has identified five industries in which she thinks Taiwanese firms can compete internationally: defence, biotechnology, clean energy, the internet of things and smart machinery—although only the last of these, notes Stephen Su of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, is currently a significant earner for local businesses.</p><p>Economic growth has picked up, from 1% year-on-year in the quarter in which Ms Tsai took office to 3% in the first quarter of this year. But workers are not feeling the benefit. Other reforms, however, have bitten. The government’s (much needed) cuts to pensions for civil servants and teachers prompted big demonstrations. Last month hundreds of veterans scuffled with police and threw smoke-bombs to protest against plans to cut military pensions too.</p><p>On social issues Ms Tsai has wobbled. Before she was elected she put out a video supporting gay marriage. But once in power, the DPP backed away and dithered. In the end it was the constitutional court that ruled in favour of gay marriage a year ago, instructing parliament to enact the necessary laws. It has not yet done so. That has left young people disillusioned, says Jason Hsu, a KMT lawmaker, who believes gay marriage was one of the main reasons Ms Tsai captured the youth vote.</p><p>Ms Tsai also promised to provide a proper accounting of the human-rights abuses committed during the KMT’s long, harsh dictatorship, and to remove all monuments glorifying this era. But she has appointed a former member of a watchdog agency under the previous KMT administration to head the committee in charge of this project. This has upset some in her own party. Meanwhile, a law that strips the KMT of wealth deemed ill-gotten has infuriated the opposition.</p><p>The KMT is still reeling from its defeat in 2016 and the legislative setbacks that followed. Its leadership is weak. But Ms Tsai faces opposition of a different sort. Two ex-presidents (one from the DPP and one from the KMT) and many prominent politicians, especially within the DPP, want her to permit a referendum on independence—something that would provoke a dire response from China. She is resisting, while counting on an economic upturn to bolster her fortunes. “We’ve spent most of my first two years in preparation, including legal preparation, so in my presidency’s next two years we will speed up the pace of implementation,” she said in her online interview.

Chinese leaders have been saying such things since the retreating Nationalists separated the island from the rest of the country after losing the civil war to the Communists in 1949. But Mr Xi has done more than just talk: he has sent bombers and warships to circle the island, held live-fire drills in the narrow Taiwan Strait and, Taiwanese generals say, instructed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to be capable of seizing Taiwan by force by next year. Back in 1996, the most recent cross-strait crisis, China’s military spending was barely twice Taiwan’s. Now it is 15 times greater. That has left Taiwanese leaders rushing to rethink their defences.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Taiwan already does a great deal to make itself indigestible to invaders. The island is “honeycombed with bunkers”, says Ian Easton of the Project 2049 Institute, an American think-tank. Tanks are hidden away in bustling neighbourhoods of Taipei. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Highway Number One was built to handle not only rush-hour traffic, but also ten-tonne fighter jets, since the island’s airfields would quickly be destroyed by Chinese missiles should war break out.</p><p>America, Taiwan’s closest military ally, has urged the island to move further towards a “porcupine strategy”. It wants Taiwan to acquire smaller, cheaper and more mobile weapons that could wear down Chinese forces close to Taiwan’s shores, in the place of big, lumbering and expensive kit such as warplanes and battleships, which are better suited to projecting firepower onto China’s mainland.</p><p>Taiwanese planners have taken note. In 2017 the country’s top military officer launched the “Overall Defence Concept”. That strategy, endorsed by Tsai Ing-wen, the president, embraces the porcupine ethos. One priority is intelligent sea mines, which can scoot around and so evade sweeping. Some are more advanced than anything in America’s arsenal. Another focus is unmanned platforms, such as remote-controlled sentry guns to guard outlying islands and armed drones to patrol the coastline. Third is an emphasis on missiles. Taiwan is churning out Hsiung Feng cruise missiles by the hundreds. These can be placed not only on small, zippy speedboats rather than bulky destroyers, but also in unmarked lorries. Such rocket-laden vehicles are hidden “in places you cannot imagine”, says one official, and could continue to operate from anywhere on the road network long after invaders had obliterated Taiwan’s fighter jets. Better yet, they are far cheaper than warplanes.</p><p>Yet not everyone is willing to jettison traditional ways of war. The new defence policy appeals to the president and her staff not only for its military virtues, but also because it favours the smaller systems that Taiwan can build itself. But the top brass has reasons beyond vanity to defend their shiny objects.</p><p>They concede that heavy tanks, big ships and fancy warplanes may not survive a head-to-head conflict with China. But they act as a deterrent and boost morale. Missiles cannot fend off prowling Chinese bombers nor speedboats patrol stormy oceans. “Parades are a form of deterrence, certainly in Asia,” notes Drew Thompson, who used to help shape policy on Taiwan at America’s Department of Defence. “Big-ticket items parade well.”</p><p>They also let Taiwan take the fight to China. Taiwan’s American-made frigates would eventually be blown out of the water, but not before their potent torpedoes might inflict serious damage on Chinese ships. That would not only boost the morale of islanders facing a hailstorm of missiles, it might also induce caution in Mr Xi.</p><p>The problem is that showcase weapons are expensive. Even domestically built submarines—Taiwan hopes to make eight—cost more than $1bn apiece; the entire annual defence budget is just $11bn. Money is even tighter because Taiwan is scrapping conscription and shifting to an all-volunteer force. And since salaried soldiers are pricier, their numbers are fewer. Taiwan’s armed forces have shed more than 150,000 people since China’s cross-strait muscle-flexing in 1996, leaving 215,000. The country’s reserve force, its second line of defence, will also shrink with every passing year. Even so, any return to compulsory enlistment would be electoral suicide, politicians say.</p><p>American arms, even big, expensive ones at odds with the porcupine philosophy, also serve a diplomatic purpose. America’s involvement in a war could be the difference between Taiwan’s survival and extinction. Just eight American submarines could sink 40% of China’s amphibious fleet in the first week of fighting, according to computer simulations by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank.</p><p>Although America does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it maintains close ties. Some 3,500-4,000 Pentagon officials travel to Taiwan every year, an average of more than ten per day. Arms sales have totalled more than $15bn since 2010. The relationship is deepening in some respects. Arms transfers were previously bundled into big packages that reliably aroused Chinese anger; they are now growing more routine.</p><p>The administration of Donald Trump is stacked with senior officials who know Taiwan well and sympathise with its plight. Mr Trump delighted Taiwan’s leaders by holding a taboo-busting phone call with Ms Tsai when he was president-elect. Last year he also signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages senior American officials to visit the island and vice versa. If arms sales help bolster America’s commitment to Taiwan, so much the better.</p><p>Though Mr Xi clearly feels obliged to continue to hound Taiwan about reunification, he has thus far avoided laying down a firm timeline. The relatively slow growth of China’s amphibious fleet casts doubt on the idea that the PLA is working flat out to be ready to invade. Nor has it been conducting big amphibious exercises. There is still time for Taiwan to sharpen its quills.</p><p>Correction (January 24th 2019): The original version of this article said that an average of more than 100 Pentagon officials travelled to Taiwan each day. Our maths let us down. Daily visitors from the Pentagon number “more than ten”. This has been corrected.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250687646','[\"236\", \"328\", \"113\"]',1,'中國可能正在迫使台灣重新考慮其軍事戰略','它想成為一個難以消化的“豪豬”','它希望台灣能夠購買更小，更便宜和更具移動性的武器，這些武器可以擊敗靠近台灣海岸的中國軍隊，代替大型，伐木和昂貴的戰機，如戰機和戰列艦，更適合向中國大陸投射火力。','<p></p><p> 1月2日，中國國家主席習近平宣布，台灣“必須和將會”與大陸團聚。中國領導人一直在說這些事情，因為撤退的民族主義者在1949年向共產黨失去內戰後將島嶼與其他國家分開。但習近平不僅僅是在說話：他派遣轟炸機和戰艦繞圈子台灣將軍說，島上在狹窄的台灣海峽舉行實彈演習，指示人民解放軍能夠在明年以武力奪取台灣。早在1996年，最近的兩岸危機，中國的軍費開支幾乎不到台灣的兩倍。現在它增加了15倍。這使得台灣領導人急於重新考慮他們的防禦。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>台灣已經做了很多讓入侵者難以消化的東西。美國智庫2049研究所的伊恩·伊斯頓說，這個島上有“蜂窩狀”。坦克隱藏在繁華的台北街區。中山紀念公路第一號高速公路不僅可以處理高峰時段的交通，還可以處理十噸級的戰鬥機，因為如果戰爭爆發，島上的機場很快就會被中國的導彈摧毀。 </p><p>美國是台灣最親密的軍事盟友，已敦促該島進一步邁向“豪豬戰略”。它希望台灣能夠購買更小，更便宜和更具移動性的武器，這些武器可以擊敗靠近台灣海岸的中國軍隊，代替大型，伐木和昂貴的戰機，如戰機和戰列艦，更適合向中國大陸投射火力。 </p><p>台灣的策劃者已經註意到了。 2017年，該國最高軍官推出了“全面防衛概念”。總統蔡英文認可的這一戰略包含了豪豬的精神。一個優先事項是智能海上礦井，它可以四處搜尋，因此可以避開席捲。有些比美國的武器庫更先進。另一個重點是無人駕駛平台，例如用於保護離島的遙控哨兵炮和用於巡邏海岸線的武裝無人機。第三是強調導彈。數百名台灣正在製造雄風巡航導彈。這些不僅可以放在小型，快速的快艇上，而且可以放在笨重的驅逐艦上，也可以放在沒有標記的卡車上。一位官員表示，這些載有火箭的車輛隱藏在“無法想像的地方”，並且在入侵者摧毀台灣戰鬥機後很長時間內，可以繼續在公路網上的任何地方進行操作。更好的是，它們比戰機便宜得多。 </p><p>然而，並不是每個人都願意放棄傳統的戰爭方式。新的國防政策不僅因為它的軍事優點而吸引了總統及其工作人員，也因為它有利於台灣可以建立的小型系統。但是，高級官員有超越虛榮的理由來保護他們閃亮的物體。 </p><p>他們承認重型坦克，大型船隻和花式戰機可能無法與中國發生直接衝突。但它們起著威懾作用，鼓舞士氣。導彈不能抵擋徘徊在中國的轟炸機，也不能用快艇巡邏暴風雨的海洋。 “遊行是一種威懾，當然在亞洲，”德魯湯普森指出，他過去常常幫助在美國國防部製定台灣政策。 “大件物品遊行很好。” </p><p>他們還讓台灣把戰鬥帶到了中國。台灣的美製護衛艦最終將被吹走水面，但在它們強大的魚雷可能對中國船隻造成嚴重破壞之前。這不僅會增加面對導彈冰雹的島民的士氣，也可能引起習近平的謹慎。 </p><p>問題是陳列武器很貴。即使是國內建造的潛艇 - 台灣也希望每艘成本超過10億美元;整個年度國防預算僅為110億美元。金錢更加緊張，因為台灣正在取消徵兵並轉向全志願軍。由於受薪士兵價格較高，他們的人數較少。自1996年中國兩岸肌肉發達以來，台灣軍隊已經減少了超過15萬人，留下了21.5萬人。該國的後備力量，即其第二道防線，也將逐年萎縮。政治家們說，即便如此，任何強制入伍的回歸都將是選舉自殺。 </p><p>美國的武器，即使是大而昂貴的武器，與豪豬的理念不一致，也是一種外交目的。美國參與戰爭可能是台灣生存和滅絕之間的差異。根據智庫蘭德公司（RAND Corporation）的計算機模擬，在戰鬥的第一周，只有8艘美國潛艇可以淹沒中國40％的兩棲艦隊。 </p><p>雖然美國與台灣沒有外交關係，但它保持著密切的聯繫。每年約有3,500-4,000名五角大樓官員前往台灣，平均每天超過10人。自2010年以來，軍售總額已超過150億美元。這種關係在某些方面正在加深。武器轉讓以前捆綁成大包裝，可以引起中國人的憤怒;他們現在越來越常規了。 </p><p>唐納德特朗普的政府與高級官員在一起，他們很了解台灣，並對其困境表示同情。特朗普先生在擔任當選總統時與蔡女士進行了一場禁忌的電話會議，令台灣領導人感到高興。去年，他還簽署了“台灣旅遊法”，鼓勵美國高級官員訪問該島，反之亦然。如果武器銷售有助於支持美國對台灣的承諾，那就更好了。 </p><p>儘管習近平明顯感到有義務繼續追捕台灣的統一，但他迄今為止已經避免制定了堅實的時間表。中國兩棲艦隊相對緩慢的增長令人懷疑中國人民解放軍是否正在準備入侵。也沒有進行大型兩棲演習。台灣還有時間磨礪它的羽毛筆。 </p><p>更正（2019年1月24日）：這篇文章的原始版本說，平均每天有超過100名五角大樓官員前往台灣。我們的數學讓我們失望。來自五角大樓的每日訪客數量“超過十”。這已得到糾正。 </p>'),(123,4,'https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/03/12/inside-taiwans-new-digital-democracy','Inside Taiwan’s new digital democracy','Public dialogue and collaboration are vital, says Audrey Tang, the Digital Minister of Taiwan','” At a time when the world is rethinking basic elements of governance, Taiwan’s digital democracy—in which the people take the initiative, and the government responds in the here and now—can serve as a demonstration of new forms of citizen and state co-operation and dialogue for the 21st century.','AUDREY TANG','2019-03-12T15:49:33Z',1552405773000,'<p>This is the third in a series of opinion pieces on how to fix democracy.</p><p>IN 2012 A controversial government advertisement in Taiwan proposed a peculiar idea: “Instead of wasting time deliberating policies, let’s focus on doing the groundwork and get things done!” In response, four programmers with a civic-minded ethos did something else entirely.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>These “civic hackers”—that is, politically minded computer programmers with an activist ethos—built a citizen auditing system for Taiwan’s central government budget. They made data from the Accounting and Statistics Office accessible, easy to understand and interactive. The public could rate and comment on every item in the budget. This became the foundation of the gØv (“gov-zero”) movement, which is now one of the world’s most active civic-tech communities.</p><p>Since then, Taiwan has put online collaboration at the core of its governance. The idea is to bring technology into the spaces where citizens live, rather than expect citizens to enter the space of technology. The premise is this: the government must first trust the people with agenda-setting power; then the people can make democracy work.</p><p>Taiwan did not always enjoy these freedoms, digital or otherwise. In 1987 martial law was lifted after nearly 40 years. The first direct presidential election took place in 1996, just as the internet was taking off. By then, Taiwan had a fairly robust civil society, built on an historic practice of community associations that used “collaborative action” to find common solutions.</p><p>The island of Taiwan is about 400km (250 miles) long, a journey of less than two hours by high-speed rail. This has proved a major advantage in deploying internet connectivity. The idea of broadband as a human right is at the core of the government’s policy. Some 87% of people over the age of 12 are connected. For a population of 23m, the internet is even more natural as a public space for discussion than the practice of voting.</p><p>Today, generations accustomed to authoritarian power and generations accustomed to freedom coexist, and occasionally clash. Yet a common thread running through our digital democracy projects is collaborative participation.</p><p>Taiwan’s national platform for online participation, called “Join”, and the Taipei City government have adopted the gØv system for projects to include the public in budget matters. Data visualisation tools help people to understand what is allocated where. The “Join” platform, with over 4m participants, extends beyond budget matters. Anyone can begin an e-petition on the platform. Once a case has 5,000 signatures, the relevant ministries must respond in public.</p><p>As Digital Minister, I have established a network of Participation Officers in each ministry. They serve as the links between the general public and the public sectors, and as channels for inter-agency collaboration. Whenever a proposal is raised, a collaborative meeting can be held, with participants from government departments and the public invited to join the discussion and to jointly create new policies.</p><p>So far we have held more than 40 collaborative meetings. We gathered stakeholders to find solutions, be it to improve the experience of filing income tax, the allocation of medical resources in remote towns, or balancing the fishery and marine biodiversity in national parks.</p><p>The adoption of civic innovations in the public sector requires an established system for regulation, maintenance and accountability. Thus, it is imperative that the government, the tech community and companies come together to form a collaborative ecosystem to amplify the impact of civic technology: code can support democratic values in a way that wasn’t previously possible.</p><p>It is only through integrating with the existing legal system, with the backing of laws and regulations, that social innovation can drive regulatory innovation. For example, we launched a Regulatory Sandbox platform in 2017, allowing entrepreneurs to experiment freely without legal constraints for a certain period of time. It is meant to spur fintech experiments and autonomous vehicles, among other innovations.</p><p>Another important driver for public participation in law-making is the vTaiwan platform, which was initiated by the gØv community. (Where the Join platform is run and maintained by the government, vTaiwan is run by citizens and maintained by gØv.) The legal status of Uber was heatedly discussed on vTaiwan, supported by a system using artificial intelligence to manage the conversation. This helped the different sides converge towards a “Diversified Taxi Services Plan” in 2016. In 2018 vTaiwan also successfully helped enact regulations for the platform economy.</p><p>In addition to lowering the barriers to democracy, this approach is also a process of mutual understanding. When the public sees the results of collaboration, it leads to more participation. Only through this cycle will it be possible for citizens to provide concrete feedback and go even further by applying, adjusting and contributing to the civic tech community.</p><p>Our goals for PDIS, the policy lab in Taiwan’s cabinet, is to bring these experimental results to people all over the world. We have visited New York, Toronto, Madrid, Tokyo and Hong Kong to co-organise workshops with civic tech communities for sharing democratic innovations, such as our Participation Officers network and collaborative meetings. The gØv programme has been transplanted internationally, with “gØv Italy” set up in 2018.</p><p>International co-operation is no longer just about agreements between governments: it is also about people building shared values. For example, at our Presidential Hackathon last year, the cross-sectoral team “Water Saviours” deployed machine learning to assist pipe repair with an accuracy rate of 70%. The team was then invited by the New Zealand government to co-create solutions to address water leakage.</p><p>People often ask me about the future of democracy. To me, democracy’s future is based on a culture of listening. Taiwan has no “legacy systems” of representative democracy (to use the language of technology) and the internet is highly developed. This means we can experiment with new modes of democracy. As President Tsai Ing-wen said at her inauguration three years ago: “Before, democracy was a showdown between two opposing values. Now, democracy is a conversation between many diverse values.”</p><p>At a time when the world is rethinking basic elements of governance, Taiwan’s digital democracy—in which the people take the initiative, and the government responds in the here and now—can serve as a demonstration of new forms of citizen and state co-operation and dialogue for the 21st century.</p><p>_________</p><p>Audrey Tang is the Digital Minister of Taiwan and the first openly transgender government minister in the world.</p><p>Author photo credit: Camille McOuat (CC BY 4.0)</p><p>Also in this series:Matthew Taylor: Citizen deliberation is the gateway to a better politicsCass Sunstein: Political savagery makes self-government impossible</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555250688192','[\"3\", \"254\", \"157\"]',1,'台灣內部新的數字民主','台灣數字部長奧德麗唐說，公眾對話和合作至關重要','“在世界正在重新思考治理的基本要素的時候，台灣的數字民主 - 人民採取主動，政府在這里和現在的反應 - 可以作為新形式的公民和國家共同的證明 - 21世紀的運作和對話。','<p>這是關於如何解決民主問題的一系列意見中的第三部分。 </p><p> 2012年台灣一則備受爭議的政府廣告提出了一個奇特的想法：“不要浪費時間審議政策，而是集中精力做好基礎工作並完成工作！”作為回應，四位具有公民意識的程序員完全做了別的事情。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>這些“公民黑客” - 具有政治頭腦的計算機程序員具有積極的精神 - 為台灣中央政府預算建立了公民審計製度。他們使會計和統計辦公室的數據易於理解，易於理解和互動。公眾可以對預算中的每個項目進行評級和評論。這成為gØv（“gov-zero”）運動的基礎，該運動現在是世界上最活躍的公民科技社區之一。 </p><p>從那以後，台灣將在線合作作為其治理的核心。我們的想法是將技術帶入公民居住的空間，而不是期望公民進入技術空間。前提是：政府必須首先相信具有議程設置權力的人民;然後人民可以使民主運作。 </p><p>台灣並不總是享受這些自由，數字或其他自由。 1987年，戒嚴法在近40年後被取消。第一次直接總統選舉發生在1996年，就像互聯網正在起飛一樣。到那時，台灣有一個相當強大的公民社會，建立在社區協會的歷史實踐基礎上，使用“協作行動”找到共同的解決方案。 </p><p>台灣島長約400公里（250英里），乘高鐵不到兩小時。事實證明，這是部署互聯網連接的一個主要優勢。寬帶作為一項人權的概念是政府政策的核心。大約87％的12歲以上的人都有聯繫。對於2300萬人口而言，互聯網作為討論的公共空間比投票實踐更自然。 </p><p>今天，習慣於專制權力的幾代人和習慣於自由的幾代人共存，偶爾也會發生衝突。然而，貫穿我們的數字民主項目的一個共同點是協作參與。 </p><p>台灣的國家在線參與平台，稱為“加入”，台北市政府已採用gØv系統進行項目，將公眾納入預算事宜。數據可視化工具可幫助人們了解在哪里分配的內容。擁有400多萬參與者的“加入”平台超越了預算範圍。任何人都可以在平台上開始電子請願。一旦案件有5,000個簽名，相關部委必須公開回應。 </p><p>作為數字部長，我在每個部都建立了一個參與官員網絡。它們是公眾和公共部門之間的聯繫，也是機構間合作的渠道。無論何時提出提案，都可以舉行協作會議，邀請政府部門和公眾的參與者參加討論並共同製定新政策。 </p><p>到目前為止，我們已舉行了40多次協作會議。我們聚集利益相關者尋找解決方案，無論是改善所得稅申報的經驗，偏遠城鎮的醫療資源分配，還是平衡國家公園的漁業和海洋生物多樣性。 </p><p>在公共部門採用公民創新需要一個既定的監管，維護和問責制度。因此，政府，技術社區和公司必須共同組成一個協作生態系統，以擴大公民技術的影響：代碼可以以前所未有的方式支持民主價值觀。 </p><p>只有通過與現有法律體系相結合，在法律法規的支持下，社會創新才能推動監管創新。例如，我們在2017年推出了一個監管沙箱平台，允許企業家在一段時間內自由地進行實驗，沒有法律限制。它旨在刺激金融科技實驗和自動駕駛汽車，以及其他創新。 </p><p>公眾參與立法的另一個重要驅動因素是vTaiwan平台，該平台由gØv社區發起。 （如果Join平台由政府運營和維護，vTaiwan由公民運營並由gØv維護。）Uber的法律地位在vTaiwan上受到激烈討論，由使用人工智能管理對話的系統支持。這有助於不同方面在2016年達成“多元化出租車服務計劃”。2018年，vTaiwan也成功幫助制定了平台經濟法規。 </p><p>除了降低民主的障礙外，這種方法也是一種相互理解的過程。當公眾看到合作的結果時，它會帶來更多的參與。只有通過這個循環，公民才有可能提供具體的反饋，並通過應用，調整和貢獻公民科技社區來進一步發展。 </p><p>我們在台灣內閣政策實驗室PDIS的目標是將這些實驗結果帶給世界各地的人們。我們訪問了紐約，多倫多，馬德里，東京和香港，與民間科技社區共同舉辦研討會，分享民主創新，例如我們的參與官網絡和協作會議。 gØv計劃已在國際上移植，並於2018年成立了“gØvItalian”。 </p><p>國際合作不再僅僅是政府之間的協議：它還涉及人們建立共同價值觀。例如，在去年的總統黑客馬拉松中，跨部門團隊“Water Saviors”部署了機器學習，以70％的準確率協助管道維修。隨後，新西蘭政府邀請該團隊共同製定解決方案以解決漏水問題。 </p><p>人們經常問我民主的未來。對我來說，民主的未來是建立在傾聽的文化基礎之上的。台灣沒有代議制民主的“遺留系統”（使用技術語言），互聯網高度發達。這意味著我們可以嘗試新的民主模式。正如蔡英文總統三年前在就職典禮上所說：“在此之前，民主是兩個相反價值觀之間的攤牌。現在，民主是許多不同價值觀之間的對話。“ </p><p>在世界正在重新思考治理的基本要素的時候，台灣的數字民主 - 人民採取主動，政府在這里和現在的反應 - 可以作為新形式的公民和國家合作的示範。和21世紀的對話。 </p><p> _________ </p><p>奧黛麗唐是台灣數字部長，也是世界上第一位公開變性的政府部長。 </p><p>作者照片來源：Camille McOuat（CC BY 4.0） </p><p>同樣在這個系列中：馬修泰勒：公民審議是通往更好政治的門戶。薩斯桑斯坦：政治野蠻使自治變得不可能</p>'),(124,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/03/21/tsai-ing-wen-taiwans-president-is-challenged-by-a-former-underling','Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, is challenged by a former underling','No incumbent seeking re-election has had to fight a primary before','And the contest may anger China, since Mr Lai is a more vocal supporter than Ms Tsai of the idea that Taiwan should formally declare itself to be a distinct country from China—a move China says would be grounds for war.','','2019-03-21T15:41:11Z',1553182871000,'<p>AS TAIWAN’S FIRST female president, Tsai Ing-wen is a trailblazer. She is well-liked abroad for her reluctance to pick fights with China. But she is not popular at home. Recent polls put her approval rating below 30%. Her bid for re-election next year, already iffy, just got iffier. Lai Ching-te, her former prime minister, has declared that he will challenge Ms Tsai for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). It is the first time an incumbent president in Taiwan has been subjected to a primary. And the contest may anger China, since Mr Lai is a more vocal supporter than Ms Tsai of the idea that Taiwan should formally declare itself to be a distinct country from China—a move China says would be grounds for war.  </p><p>“Taiwan doesn’t want to be a second Hong Kong or Tibet,” declared Mr Lai as he registered for the primary this week, insinuating that Ms Tsai is not doing enough to ensure Taiwan’s independence. The DPP was thrashed in municipal elections in November by the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, which advocates warmer relations with China. Voters seemed disappointed that Ms Tsai’s efforts to stimulate the economy have had scant success. Growth is slowing. Wages have been stagnant for decades.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Following the defeat in November, Ms Tsai stepped down as leader of the DPP. A month later Mr Lai, a former mayor of the southern city of Tainan, resigned as prime minister, spurning Ms Tsai’s entreaties for him to stay. The primary will involve the two candidates giving televised presentations of their platforms, after which the party conducts an opinion poll of a sample of the whole electorate. The more popular candidate wins the nomination. The results will be announced on April 17th.</p><p>DPP activists had been panicking, as Ms Tsai has been trailing badly in the polls. They feared not only a further electoral setback, but one that would have put the government into the hands of a China-friendly leader just as China is pressing Taiwan to begin talks on unification. Some advocates of independence, fed up with Ms Tsai’s caution, are jubilant at Mr Lai’s announcement, both because they think Mr Lai has a better chance of winning and because they think he might be more assertive.</p><p>Ms Tsai’s supporters, meanwhile, are arguing that the primary could split the party and are making agonised calls for unity, by which they seem to mean Mr Lai’s withdrawal. Chen Chi-mai, the deputy prime minister and a supporter of Ms Tsai, argued in a Facebook post that China’s growing assertiveness makes divisions within the party especially dangerous. “The 2020 election will determine whether Taiwan survives or is extinguished,” he said. </p><p>Luckily for the DPP, the KMT also has no anointed candidate and its primary is still some months away. A former mayor of New Taipei City, Eric Chu, and a former speaker of parliament, Wang Jin-pyng, have both said they will run. The election will probably also feature an independent candidate, Ko Wen-je, the popular mayor of Taipei.  </p><p> Inevitably, China will be front and centre in the campaign. The authorities across the Taiwan Strait probably revile Mr Lai even more than they do Ms Tsai. That might encourage them to ease the pressure on Taiwan a bit over the next few months. The Chinese government knows from experience that attempts to intimidate Taiwanese voters tend to backfire, prompting them to back the candidate most hostile to its cherished goal of reunification.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1555377243903','[\"114\", \"325\", \"126\"]',1,'台灣總統蔡英文受到前任下屬的挑戰','沒有任何一位尋求連任的人不得不在此之前與小學打架','這場比賽可能會激怒中國，因為賴先生比蔡女士更有聲稱支持台灣應該正式宣布自己是一個與中國截然不同的國家 - 中國認為這將成為戰爭的理由。','<p>作為台灣第一位女總統，蔡英文是開拓者。由於不願意與中國打架，她在國外很受歡迎。但她在家裡並不受歡迎。最近的民意調查顯示，她的支持率低於30％。她競選明年的連任，已經是不確定的，只是變得更加有效。她的前總理賴清德宣布，他將向蔡女士挑戰民主進步黨（DPP）的總統候選人提名。這是台灣現任總統第一次受到初選。這場比賽可能會激怒中國，因為賴先生比蔡女士更有聲稱支持台灣應該正式宣布自己是一個與中國截然不同的國家 - 中國認為這將成為戰爭的理由。 </p><p> “台灣不希望成為第二個香港或西藏，”黎先生在本週註冊小學時表示，暗示蔡女士在確保台灣獨立方面做得不夠。民進黨在11月的市政選舉中遭到國民黨（國民黨）的抨擊，國民黨是主要的反對黨，主張與中國建立更溫暖的關係。選民似乎對蔡英文刺激經濟的努力取得的成功感到失望。增長正在放緩。幾十年來，工資一直停滯不前。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>在11月失敗後，蔡女士辭去民進黨領導職務。一個月後，南方城市台南的前市長賴先生辭去總理職務，摒棄蔡女士的懇求，讓他留下來。初選將涉及兩名候選人提供他們平台的電視轉播，之後該黨對整個選民的樣本進行民意調查。更受歡迎的候選人贏得了提名。結果將於4月17日公佈。 </p><p>民進黨的積極分子一直在恐慌，因為蔡女士在民意調查中的表現非常糟糕。他們不僅擔心會受到進一步的選舉挫折，而且還會讓政府落入中國友好領導人的手中，正如中國迫使台灣開始統一談判一樣。一些支持蔡女士謹慎行為的獨立倡導者對賴先生的宣布感到高興，因為他們認為賴先生有更好的獲勝機會，因為他們認為他可能更加自信。 </p><p>與此同時，蔡女士的支持者們認為，主要人士可能會分裂黨派，並且正在激動地呼籲團結，這似乎意味著賴先生的退出。副總理兼蔡女士的支持者陳志邁在一篇Facebook帖子中指出，中國日益增強的自信心使得黨內的分歧特別危險。他說：“2020年的選舉將決定台灣是否存活或被淘汰。” </p><p>對於民進黨來說幸運的是，國民黨也沒有受膏的候選人，其主要任期還有幾個月之後。新台北市前市長Eric Chu和前議長王金平都表示會參選。這次選舉可能還會有一位獨立候選人，即台北的市長Ko Wen-je。 </p><p>中國將不可避免地成為這場運動的前沿和中心。台灣海峽當局可能比對蔡女士更加辱罵賴先生。這可能會鼓勵他們在未來幾個月內緩解對台灣的壓力。中國政府從經驗中了解到，企圖恐嚇台灣選民的做法往往會適得其反，促使他們支持對其珍視的統一目標最敵視的候選人。 </p>'),(126,5,'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/04/director-tsai-ming-liang-taiwan-long-take-watermelon-sex','\nTsai Ming-liang: master of long takes and watermelon sex\n','\n\nThis ‘slow cinema’ legend has now abandoned all dialogue.

Now, it’s more like going into a shopping mall,” says Tsai Ming-liang. Over the course of his nearly 30-year career, the Taiwanese film-maker’s work has moved further and further towards the “temple” end of the spectrum. Often bracketed under the “slow cinema” movement, he is a master of the very long take. His last feature, 2013’s Stray Dogs, included a shot of two people staring at a mural in an abandoned building that lasted over 14 minutes. But despite his shaven head, Tsai is no monk. In the past, his films have featured choreographed musical sequences, surreal comedy, and plenty of sex – gay, straight, solo, even watermelon-incorporating, in the case of 2005’s The Wayward Cloud.</p><p>In person, he is unassuming and quick to laugh. “In the past I really cared if people understood my films, but when you grow older, you care less,” says Tsai, who turned 61 last year. “You want to do something to please yourself. I feel like the film industry has trapped film-makers. They tell you you need to have a narrative structure, you need to do things a certain way. They limit the imaginations of film-makers. I often think about, what is the meaning of film? What does film want to say? The simple thing is, film is about images.”</p><p>After Stray Dogs, which won a host of international awards, Tsai claimed he was giving up commercial cinema altogether, but few could have anticipated where he would go next: virtual reality. The Deserted is possibly Tsai’s most contemplative work yet. Free of dialogue and narrative, it is set in a derelict, overgrown apartment block in the Taiwanese countryside, occupied by a man with neck pains, and what could be the ghosts of his mother and wife, and a large, white pet fish. The viewer becomes an invisible spectator to this surreal domestic tableau. The action is unhurried but never dull to look at, and you can always swivel round on your chair to appreciate the stained concrete walls, the puddles on the floor and the lush greenery outside the pane-less windows.</p><p>Tsai is one of the most consistent auteurs cinema has ever known, and aficionados will recognise many of his trademarks in The Deserted: the man is Tsai’s regular actor Lee Kang-sheng – whom he first cast in 1991, and has not made a film without since; derelict buildings and water also frequently feature in his work. Ghosts, too: in Goodbye, Dragon Inn, the living and the dead communed in a condemned Taipei cinema (screening King Hu’s 1967 martial arts classic Dragon Inn). Lee’s neck pain was also a theme in 1997’s The River. The white fish was also seen in 2001’s What Time Is It There? when the mother believed it to be the reincarnated spirit of her dead husband. The Deserted is a film full of ghosts, and thanks to virtual reality, the viewer becomes another one.</p><p>“I’m a Buddhist,” says Tsai. “When I enter a new space, especially ruins or an abandoned place, I often say hello and have a little chat. I always feel there is someone there, a fairy, ghost or spirit.” The Mandarin title of The Deserted translates as The Home at Lan Re Temple, Tsai explains, which comes from a Chinese ghost story. “The Lan Re temple in Buddhism is actually a space for all the spirits to gather around. This is their space.” The Deserted was shot next door to the abandoned building where Tsai and Lee moved five years ago, to get back to nature and help Lee’s recovery after a stroke and a mystery recurring illness (the neck pain is real). Another recent film, Afternoon, also shot in an abandoned building nearby, is a conversation between the two men, about their long relationship, personal and professional.</p><p>“Through film-making, I have discovered the concept of time,” Tsai says. Having worked with the same subjects and casts for decades, his films have become a way of capturing the ghosts of the past and tracking time’s passage, whether in the face of Lee or the landscapes of rapidly developing Taiwan.</p><p>Tsai, born in Malaysia, came to Taiwan as a student in 1985 when the country was still under martial law. That ended two years later, and Tsai became part of a new wave of renowned Taiwanese film-makers, including Ang Lee, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang. They didn’t just benefit from Taiwan’s liberalisation, they helped make it happen, Tsai explains. “Me and many other film-makers were fighting the system, trying to make it more open. If you look at Asia now, Taiwan is the most open-minded and welcoming to all ways of film-making.”</p><p>Tsai never stopped making films after Stray Dogs, he says; he just found other ways to do it, and different places to show them. Where his contemporaries have struggled to compete with Hollywood and Chinese blockbusters in the “shopping mall”, Tsai has turned to museums and art galleries to show his work. “Many people tell me I should have disappeared a long time ago,” he laughs. But instead, to his surprise, he has found new viewers. “In Asia right now, my audiences are more people in their teens and 20s than people of my generation,” he says. “Maybe it’s because they are the internet generation, they see so much information every day. So when they experience my films they maybe feel something different. They have no baggage about ‘what is film?’”</p><p>As well as honouring cinema’s past, perhaps Tsai’s meditative works points the way to its future.</p><p>• A retrospective of Tsai Ming-Liang’s films, curated by the director himself, and including the UK premiere of The Deserted (4-8 April), is part of of the UK Taiwan film festival, from 3-14 April.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/guardian/1555852505024','[\"318\", \"309\", \"249\"]',2,'\n蔡明亮：長期和西瓜性的大師\n','\n\n這個“慢電影”傳奇現在放棄了所有對話。隨著英國台灣電影節的揭幕，他談到了他最新的作品 - 關於一個患有頸部疼痛的人，他擁有一條魚\n','Tsai是電影院最知名的電影公司之一，而且愛好者會認出他在“被遺棄者”中的許多商標：這位男士是蔡的常規演員李康生 - 他於1991年首次演員，並且沒有製作過一部電影。以來;廢棄的建築和水也經常出現在他的工作中。','<p> “在我童年時代，電影就像進入一座寺廟。現在，它更像是進入一個購物中心，“蔡明亮說。在他近30年的職業生涯中，台灣電影製片人的工作已經越來越走向光譜的“太陽穴”。在“慢電影”運動中經常被置於括號內，他是很長時間拍攝的大師。他的最後一部電影，2013年的流浪狗，包括兩個人在一座廢棄的建築物中盯著壁畫拍攝，拍攝時間超過14分鐘。但是，儘管他剃了頭，蔡不是和尚。在過去，他的電影中有精心設計的音樂序列，超現實的喜劇和大量的性愛 - 同性戀，筆直，獨奏，甚至是西瓜融合，在2005年的The Wayward Cloud中。 </p><p>親自，他謙遜而且快笑。 “過去我真的很在乎人們是否理解我的電影，但是當你長大後，你會更少關心，”去年年滿61歲的蔡說。 “你想做點什麼來討好自己。我覺得電影業已經困住了電影製片人。他們告訴你需要有一個敘事結構，你需要以某種方式做事。它們限制了電影製作者的想像力。我經常想一想，電影是什麼意思？電影想說什麼？簡單的說就是，電影是關於圖像的。“ </p><p>在獲得一系列國際獎項的Stray Dogs之後，Tsai聲稱他完全放棄了商業電影，但很少有人能夠預料到他接下來會去哪裡：虛擬現實。荒廢可能是蔡的最沉思的工作。它沒有對話和敘事，它位於台灣鄉村一個被遺棄的，雜草叢生的公寓樓裡，被一個頸痛的男人所佔據，可能是他母親和妻子的鬼魂，還有一條大而白的寵物魚。觀眾成為這個超現實的家庭畫面的隱形觀眾。這個動作是不緊不慢的，但從不沉悶，你可以隨時在椅子上旋轉，欣賞骯髒的混凝土牆，地板上的水坑和無窗格窗戶外的鬱鬱蔥蔥的綠色植物。 </p><p> Tsai是電影院最知名的電影公司之一，而且愛好者會認出他在“被遺棄者”中的許多商標：這位男士是蔡的常規演員李康生 - 他於1991年首次演員，並且沒有製作過一部電影。以來;廢棄的建築和水也經常出現在他的工作中。幽靈也是：在再見，龍旅館，生活和死者在一個被譴責的台北電影院（放映胡錦濤的1967年武術經典龍旅館）。 Lee的頸部疼痛也是1997年The River的一個主題。 2001年的白色魚也出現了什麼時間？當母親認為這是她死去的丈夫的轉世精神。 The Deserted是一部充滿幽靈的電影，由於虛擬現實，觀眾成為另一個。 </p><p> “我是佛教徒，”蔡說。 “當我進入一個新的空間，特別是廢墟或廢棄的地方時，我經常打個招呼並聊聊。我總覺得那裡有一個人，一個仙女，一個幽靈或靈魂。“Tsai的普通話題名翻譯為Lan Re Temple的家，Tsai解釋說，這是一個中國鬼故事。 “佛教中的蘭Re寺實際上是所有靈魂聚集在一起的空間。這是他們的空間。“被遺棄的人被拍到隔離了Laai和Lee五年前搬遷的廢棄建築的隔壁，回歸大自然，幫助Lee在中風和神秘復發疾病後恢復（頸部疼痛是真實的）。最近的另一部電影“下午”也在附近的一棟廢棄建築中拍攝，是兩人之間的對話，關於他們長期的關係，個人和專業。 </p><p> “通過電影製作，我發現了時間的概念，”蔡說。幾十年來，他與同一主題和演員一起工作，無論是面對李還是快速發展的台灣風景，他的電影都成為捕捉過去的鬼魂和追踪時間通道的一種方式。 </p><p>蔡，出生於馬來西亞，1985年作為學生來到台灣，當時該國還處於戒嚴狀態。兩年後結束，Tsai成為新一波台灣著名電影製片人的一部分，包括李安，侯孝賢和楊德華。 Tsai解釋說，他們不僅受益於台灣的自由化，還幫助實現了這一目標。 “我和許多其他電影製作人正在對抗該系統，試圖讓它更加開放。如果你現在看亞洲，台灣是最開放的，歡迎各種電影製作方式。“ </p><p>他說，Tsai在Stray Dogs之後從未停止製作電影;他只是找到了其他方法來實現它，以及不同的地方來展示它們。在他的同時代人在“購物中心”中與好萊塢和中國大片競爭的同時，Tsai轉向博物館和藝術畫廊展示他的作品。 “很多人告訴我，我很久以前就應該失踪了，”他笑著說。但令他驚訝的是，他找到了新的觀眾。 “現在在亞洲，我的觀眾比他們這一代的人更多的是十幾歲和二十幾歲的人，”他說。 “也許是因為他們是互聯網一代，他們每天都看到這麼多信息。因此，當他們體驗我的電影時，他們可能會感受到不同他們沒有關於“什麼是電影？”的包袱。 </p><p>除了紀念電影的過去，也許蔡的冥想作品指明了未來的道路。 </p><p> •由導演親自策劃的蔡明亮電影的回顧展，以及英國首映的The Deserted（4月4日至8日），是4月3日至14日英國台灣電影節的一部分。 </p>'),(127,5,'https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/27/taiwanese-game-removed-from-sale-after-anti-china-messages-discovered','\nTaiwanese game removed from sale after anti-China messages discovered\n','\n\nMentions of game including hidden message comparing Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh also scrubbed from social media site Weibo\n','Taiwanese horror game Devotion has been removed from sale globally, following a backlash after a hidden message referencing Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie-the-Pooh was discovered in-game.','\nPatrick Lum','2019-02-27T12:56:47+0000',1551272207000,'<p>Taiwanese horror game Devotion has been removed from sale globally, following a backlash after a hidden message referencing Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie-the-Pooh was discovered in-game.</p><p>Devotion, by the Taiwanese indie developer Red Candle Games, was released on 19 February and was initially popular among horror enthusiasts.

By turns galumphing and graceful, the roughly £260m hulk contains an opera house, concert hall, theatre and recital hall, seating up to 7,000 people within its curvaceous shell. As Taiwan faces ever more pressure for assimilation from mainland China, whose cultural building boom has led to a new museum or concert hall open practically every week in recent years, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts, AKA Weiwuying, is a monumental statement that this plucky nation means business on the international cultural stage.</p><p>Gaping openings in the building’s hefty flanks beckon you into a cave-like landscape, where the floor rides up in great waves as the ceiling plunges down to meet the ground, forming a world of tunnels and canyons. The glossy-white steel skin is sliced open in places, bringing shafts of light into the space and offering intriguing glimpses of the venues within. It provides cooling respite from the tropical heat of this coastal city, channelling the breeze beneath its bulging belly to make a welcome place for picnics, tai-chi, yoga classes and some exhilarating swings.</p><p>“We were struck by the informality of the performing arts in Taiwan,” says Dutch architect Francine Houben, whose practice, Mecanoo (designers of the Birmingham Library), won the competition for the project in 2007. “Chinese opera has its origins in street theatre, so we wanted to make a place that would feel as casual and informal as going to see a performance in the park.”</p><p>The venue’s ambience is more that of a leisure centre than an opera house, particularly compared with Taipei’s national theatre and concert hall, each built in 1987, which stand on either side of the capital’s central square, like a pair of regal temples from the Forbidden City. By contrast, Weiwuying’s artistic director, Chien Wen-Pin, hopes people will spill into its theatres from the park, and treat it as their living room. “We had over 50,000 people turn up to our open day,” he says. “People occupied the space in a way were weren’t planning or expecting, taking their shoes off, doing exercise, lying in the shade, even breaking into song as they entered the concert hall.”</p><p>Featuring the largest organ in Asia, designed as two thickets of bamboo with more than 9,000 pipes, the concert hall is a swirling symphony of oak and champagne-coloured seats, with a 22-tonne acoustic reflector dangling ominously from the ceiling. Despite its 2,000-person capacity, it feels surprisingly intimate, the furthest seat being 30 metres from the conductor. The Parisian magician of acoustics, Albert Xu, built a 1:10 model of it to ensure it provides the perfect reverberation time for everything from a classical orchestra to the twanging of the Taiwanese aboriginal mouth harp. He also worked his magic on the other three spaces, each designed with a distinct character and calibrated to accommodate a variety of art forms.</p><p>The 434-seat recital hall has an asymmetrical seating layout, “so more people can see the pianists’ fingers”, say the architects, while its panelled walls can rotate to provide different levels of absorption, whether it’s hosting harsher classical Chinese music or jazz, or softer baroque chamber music. The playhouse, with deep blue seats, can accommodate an orchestra to the side of the stage (important for Chinese opera, where there must be a direct line of sight between the musicians and performers). Meanwhile, the deep red 2,236-seat opera house enjoys a humungous backstage, four times the size of the auditorium, conceived as a “theatre machine” that can contain the scenery and equipment for five different shows at once. “It’s even bigger and better equipped than Beijing’s opera,” Houben whispers conspiratorially about an important point of national pride.</p><p>If the auditoria are exemplars of their kind, then the circulation and foyer space between them feels a little like an afterthought. With the four ovoid venues set in a rectangular volume stretching 225 metres long by 160 metres wide, there is a lot of leftover space, mainly decked out with acres of grey carpet, plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, every surface painted black or white, giving it a rather bleak, monotonous feeling. Within the building there is little of the spatial drama promised by the undulating plaza outside. Instead, it has the air of a deep-plan office block with theatrical ambitions.</p><p>The architects are quick to point out that the budget is actually very tight for a project of this scale, which necessitated some of the prosaic fittings. While Jean Nouvel’s Philharmonie de Paris cost £340m, and Herzog & de Meuron’s Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg was a whopping £690m (each housing a single auditorium), Mecanoo has provided four theatres in one for a fraction of the price.</p><p>The robust, rough-and-ready quality is also somehow appropriate for the nature of this no-nonsense port city. “We wanted it to have the detailing of a cargo ship, not a luxury yacht,” says Houben, referring to the visible steel welding joints between the panels of the building’s billowing white hull. Those who aren’t told of the container ship allusion might just think it is badly finished, but various nautical markings reinforce the seafaring air.</p><p>The bigger question is if this city of three million, which has enjoyed a single 1,600-capacity theatre until now, has the ability to fill such an enormous complex on a regular basis. The director of the £106m National Taichung theatre, another ambitious cave-like opera house, an hour away by train and built by Toyo Ito in 2015, admits it is struggling to sell tickets to its current run of Wagner’s Siegfried, after the novelty of the venue’s opening has worn off. Taipei, meanwhile, awaits the opening of its long-delayed £133m performing arts centre designed by OMA, another theatre, concert hall and blackbox auditorium combined in a thrilling multilayered transformer of a building.</p><p>It is an extraordinary abundance of venues for one country to be opening in the span of a few years, all planned in the mid-2000s by different regional and national administrations. As China picks off Taiwan’s allies with dollar diplomacy (only 17 countries now recognise the island as independent, thereby disqualifying themselves from formal relations with China), it seems as if cultural diplomacy is one of the few weapons it has left.</p><p>If the palpable level of excitement in Kaohsiung on the opening night of Weiwuying last week is anything to go by – when tens of thousands gathered in the park for a spectacular gala performance staged on the building’s outdoor amphitheatre, complete with an aerial ballet of drones – there’s an eager population waiting to fill its great halls with life.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/guardian/1555852506153','[\"402\", \"3\", \"4\"]',1,'\n史詩般的場景：台灣地球上最大的藝術場所\n','\n\n台灣高雄擁有亞洲最大的風琴和四個劇院，這個巨大的表演藝術場地邀請人們鍛煉身體，打盹甚至闖入歌曲\n','隨著台灣面臨來自中國大陸同化的壓力越來越大，其文化建設熱潮導致近年來幾乎每週開放一個新的博物館或音樂廳，國立高雄藝術中心AKA魏武英，這是一個巨大的聲明，這個勇敢的國家意味著國際文化舞台上的商業。','<p>這個世界上最大的表演藝術中心看起來就像集裝箱船和鯨魚的巨大愛孩子，在台灣南部城市高雄的魏武營公園的樹梢上扭動著，擁有相當大的存在感。大約2.6億英鎊的廢船包含了歌劇院，音樂廳，劇院和演奏廳，在其曲線美的外殼內可容納7,000人。隨著台灣面臨來自中國大陸同化的壓力越來越大，其文化建設熱潮導致近年來幾乎每週開放一個新的博物館或音樂廳，國立高雄藝術中心AKA魏武英，這是一個巨大的聲明，這個勇敢的國家意味著國際文化舞台上的商業。 </p><p>在建築物的巨大側面開口，讓你進入一個洞穴般的景觀，當天花板下降到地面時，地板會以巨浪的形式上升，形成一個隧道和峽谷的世界。光滑的白色鋼皮在各處切開，將光線帶入空間，並提供內部場地的迷人一瞥。它為這個沿海城市的熱帶炎熱提供了涼爽的喘息機會，在其膨脹的腹部下方引導微風，為野餐，太極拳，瑜伽課和一些令人振奮的鞦韆提供了一個受歡迎的場所。 </p><p> “我們對台灣表演藝術的非正式性感到震驚，”荷蘭建築師Francine Houben表示，他的實踐Mecanoo（伯明翰圖書館的設計師）在2007年贏得了該項目的競爭。“中國戲曲起源於街頭劇院，所以我們想要一個讓人覺得隨意和非正式的地方，以便在公園裡觀看表演。“ </p><p>場地的氛圍更像是一個休閒中心而不是歌劇院，特別是台北的國家劇院和音樂廳，每個都建於1987年，位於首都中心廣場的兩側，就像一對來自Forbidden的皇家寺廟市。相比之下，魏武英的藝術總監錢文品希望人們從公園裡湧入劇院，把它當作自己的起居室。 “我們有超過50,000人參加我們的開放日，”他說。 “人們在某種程度上佔據了空間，沒有計劃或期待，脫鞋，做運動，躺在陰涼處，甚至在進入音樂廳時闖入歌曲。” </p><p>音樂廳擁有亞洲最大的風琴，設計為兩個竹子叢，管道超過9,000個，是一個由橡木和香檳色座椅組成的旋轉交響樂，22噸重的聲學反射器懸掛在天花板上。儘管擁有2000人的容量，但感覺非常親密，最遠的座位距指揮30米。聲學家巴黎魔術師阿爾伯特·許建立了1:10的模型，以確保它為從古典樂團到台灣原住民口琴的各種音樂提供完美的混響時間。他還在其他三個空間中施展了他的魔力，每個空間都設計有獨特的角色，並經過校準以適應各種藝術形式。 </p><p>建築師說，這座擁有434個座位的演奏廳有一個不對稱的座位佈局，“所以更多的人可以看到鋼琴家的手指”，而它的鑲板牆可以旋轉以提供不同程度的吸收，無論是舉辦更嚴酷的中國古典音樂還是爵士樂，或更柔和的巴洛克室內音樂。劇院有深藍色的座位，可以容納一個管弦樂隊到舞台的一側（對於中國歌劇來說很重要，音樂家和表演者之間必須有直接的視線）。與此同時，這座擁有2,236個座位的深紅色歌劇院位於後台，是觀眾席面積的四倍，被設想為“劇院機器”，可以同時包含五個不同節目的風景和設備。 “它比北京的歌劇更大，裝備更好，”Houben陰謀悄悄地談論民族自豪感的重要一點。 </p><p>如果禮堂是同類的典範，那麼他們之間的流通和門廳空間感覺有點像事後的想法。四個卵形場地設置成一個長225米，寬160米的矩形體積，有很多剩餘的空間，主要是用數英畝的灰色地毯，石膏板牆和吊頂天花板裝飾，每個表面塗成黑色或白色，給它一種相當暗淡，單調的感覺。在建築物內，外面起伏的廣場所承諾的空間劇很少。相反，它擁有一個具有戲劇野心的深度計劃辦公大樓。 </p><p>建築師很快指出，對於這種規模的項目，預算實際上非常緊張，這需要一些平凡的配件。雖然Jean Nouvel的Philharmonie de Paris花費了3.4億英鎊，而Herzog＆de Meuron在漢堡的Elbphilharmonie則高達6.9億英鎊（每個都有一個禮堂），Mecanoo以一小部分價格提供了四個劇院。 </p><p>堅固，粗糙和準備好的質量也適合這個嚴肅的港口城市的性質。 “我們希望它能夠詳細描述一艘貨船，而不是豪華遊艇，”Houben說，指的是建築物滾滾的白色船體的面板之間的可見鋼焊接接頭。那些沒有被告知集裝箱船典故的人可能只是認為它已經完成了，但各種航海標記加強了航海空氣。 </p><p>更大的問題是，這座擁有1600個容量劇院的300萬人口城市是否有能力定期填補這樣一個巨大的建築群。這座價值1.06億英鎊的國家台中劇院的導演是另一個雄心勃勃的洞穴式歌劇院，距離一小時的火車，由東洋伊藤於2015年建造，承認它正在努力出售其當前的瓦格納的齊格弗里德的門票。場地的開放已經消失。與此同時，台北等待由OMA設計的長期推遲的1.33億英鎊表演藝術中心的開幕，另一個劇院，音樂廳和黑匣子禮堂，以及一座驚心動魄的建築多層變壓器。 </p><p>這是一個非常豐富的場地，一個國家將在幾年內開放，所有這些場所都計劃在2000年代中期由不同的區域和國家行政當局進行。隨著中國以美元外交手段挑選台灣的盟友（現在只有17個國家認可該島是獨立的，從而取消了與中國的正式關係），文化外交似乎是它留下的為數不多的武器之一。 </p><p>如果上周威武營開幕之夜高雄的興奮程度可以接受 - 當成千上萬的人聚集在公園裡，在建築的戶外圓形劇場上演一場壯觀的慶祝表演時，還有無人機的空中芭蕾舞 - 有一群急切的人在等待著充滿生機的大廳。 </p>'),(139,5,'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/air-pollution-linked-to-greater-risk-of-mouth-cancer-finds-study','\nAir pollution linked to greater risk of mouth cancer, finds study\n','\n\nResearch in Taiwan has show a link between very high levels of air pollution and oral cancer\n','After taking into account factors including age, exposure to ozone, levels of other particulates, age, smoking status and whether the men chewed betel quid – a mixture of ingredients that includes areca nut and betel leaf and is known to increase the risk of mouth cancer – the researchers found that men exposed to the highest levels of PM2.','\nNicola Davis','2018-10-09T23:30:31+0100',1539124231000,'<p>High levels of air pollution are linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer, new research has revealed.</p><p>Scientists have previously linked high air pollution to a host of health problems, from an increased risk of dementia to asthma and even changes in the structure of the heart, with recent research suggesting there is no “safe level” of air pollution.</p><p>Now researchers say that at very high levels of air pollution, the risk of developing mouth cancer appears to rise.</p><p>Writing in the Journal of Investigative Medicine, researchers in Taiwan describe how they discovered the association by looking at air pollution data from 66 air quality monitoring stations around the country collected in 2009, and combing this with data from the health records of more than 480,000 men aged 40 and over from 2012/13.

According to figures from the WHO, the average annual level of PM2.5s in Kabul is 86 μg/m3, while in Beijing it is 85 μg/m3 and in Delhi it has been recorded at 122 μg/m3.</p><p>But the study has limitations, including that it is does not consider the men’s previous exposure to air pollution over their lifetime – which may have been higher or lower than their recent exposure.</p><p>Prof Frank Kelly, chair in environmental health at King’s College London, who was not involved in the study, said it would be useful to explore whether a link between mouth cancer and air pollution is seen in other countries.</p><p>“Air pollution has previously been linked with several types of cancer, including breast, liver, lung and pancreatic cancer. It is therefore not surprising that this new study in Taiwan has made a possible link with mouth cancer,” he said. “However, given that air pollution concentrations and smoking incidence are much lower in the UK and we don’t chew betel all suggest that the increased risk of developing mouth cancer may be unique to Taiwan.”</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/guardian/1555852504719','[\"348\", \"91\", \"266\"]',1,'\n研究發現，空氣污染與口腔癌的風險增加有關\n','\n\n台灣的研究表明，高水平的空氣污染與口腔癌之間存在聯繫\n','考慮了包括年齡，暴露於臭氧，其他顆粒水平，年齡，吸煙狀況以及男性是否咀嚼檳榔等因素 - 包括檳榔和檳榔葉的成分混合物，已知會增加患口腔癌的風險 - 研究人員發現，男性暴露於最高水平的PM2。','<p>新研究顯示，高水平的空氣污染與口腔癌的風險增加有關。 </p><p>科學家此前已將高空氣污染與一系列健康問題聯繫起來，從癡呆症風險增加到哮喘甚至心臟結構改變，最近的研究表明，空氣污染沒有“安全水平”。 </p><p>現在研究人員表示，在非常高的空氣污染水平下，患口腔癌的風險似乎會增加。 </p><p>台灣研究人員在“調查醫學雜誌”上撰文，描述了他們如何通過查看2009年收集的全國66個空氣質量監測站的空氣污染數據來發現這種關聯，並將其與超過48萬人的健康記錄數據相結合。從2012/13開始，年齡在40歲以上。參與者共有1,1617例口腔癌病例。 </p><p>該團隊專注於被稱為PM2.5s的微小污染顆粒，並根據他們居住的地方將這些人員暴露於空氣污染中。然後，他們將參與者分為四組，從最低到最高暴露水平。 </p><p>考慮了包括年齡，暴露於臭氧，其他顆粒水平，年齡，吸煙狀況以及男性是否咀嚼檳榔等因素 - 包括檳榔和檳榔葉的成分混合物，已知會增加患口腔癌的風險 - 研究人員發現暴露於最高PM2.5水平的男性患口腔癌的風險增加。 </p><p>以前空氣污染與幾種類型的癌症有關</p><p>與暴露於平均每年PM2.5水平26.74微克（μg）/立方米（m3）空氣的男性相比，暴露於40.37微克/立方米或更高濃度的人患這種疾病的機率高出43％。 </p><p> “發生這種情況的機制尚不清楚，因此需要進一步調查，”研究人員寫道。 </p><p>世界衛生組織（WHO）此前曾表示，PM2.5s的年平均水平不應超過10μg/ m3。雖然在倫敦市中心的平均年度數據已經發現翻了一倍，但仍遠低於台灣研究中的最高水平。 </p><p>然而，世界上許多其他城市的空氣污染程度極高。根據世界衛生組織的數據，喀布爾的PM2.5s年平均水平為86微克/立方米，而北京的平均年水平為85微克/立方米，而在德里則為122微克/立方米。 </p><p>但這項研究有局限性，包括它不考慮男性以前在其一生中接觸空氣污染的情況 - 這可能高於或低於他們最近的暴露。 </p><p>倫敦國王學院環境健康系主任弗蘭克凱利教授表示，探討口腔癌與空氣污染之間是否存在其他國家之間的聯繫將是有益的。 </p><p> “空氣污染以前與幾種類型的癌症有關，包括乳腺癌，肝癌，肺癌和胰腺癌。因此，這項在台灣進行的新研究與口腔癌有關，這並不奇怪，“他說。 “然而，考慮到英國的空氣污染濃度和吸煙率低得多，我們不會咀嚼檳榔，這一切都表明發生口腔癌的風險增加可能是台灣特有的。” </p>'),(140,5,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/keir-starmer-visits-taiwan-to-lobby-against-death-penalty','\nKeir Starmer visits Taiwan to lobby against death penalty\n','\n\nLabour frontbencher and former DPP will meet senior judiciary and politicians\n','Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, will fly out to Taiwan this weekend to lobby against the death penalty in an initiative also aimed at demonstrating the UK’s continued commitment to international legal standards following the EU referendum.','\nOwen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent','2018-09-29T10:05:34+0100',1538211934000,'<p>Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, will fly out to Taiwan this weekend to lobby against the death penalty in an initiative also aimed at demonstrating the UK’s continued commitment to international legal standards following the EU referendum.</p><p>His four-day trip, which is supported by the Foreign Office, will include meetings with the country’s vice-president, minister of justice and senior judiciary.

During the earlier stop, she met with three California lawmakers, including one, Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat, who called on the United States to formally invite her to Washington, which would break with decades of American practice.</p><p>The United States has not officially recognised Taiwan since 1979, when it shifted to recognising China’s communist government. China hopes to absorb the self-governed, democratic island, which it has never controlled, and has campaigned to erase any recognition by other countries or corporations of Taiwan’s sovereignty.</p><p>The visits to Houston and Los Angeles are considered “transit stops” rather than official visits, part of a long-standing restriction imposed by the United States to maintain better relations with China. But Beijing has objected even to such brief stop-overs, and the most recent ones came after President Donald Trump demonstrated willingness to provoke China’s anger.</p><p>Mr Trump has imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, touching off a trade war, and in March he signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the kind of high-level, official visits the United States and Taiwan have not had in many years. Ms Tsai’s most recent transit stops were her first since Mr Trump signed the act into law.</p><p>While there were no expectations that Mr Trump would meet his Taiwanese counterpart, there were small indications that the United States was willing to be more welcoming to Taiwanese presidents.</p><p>In a first, Taiwanese journalists were permitted to follow Ms Tsai and report from the sites of events she attended. She visited Taiwan’s de facto consulate in Los Angeles – another first – and she addressed American media at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Los Angeles.</p><p>“There were pictures of her meeting crowds of local Taiwanese, accompanied by police escort, and giving a speech at the Reagan library,” said Julian Ku, professor at Hofstra Law School. “All of that significantly raised her public profile and made her seem more like a normal leader making a normal visit to a foreign country.”</p><p>She met with Republican and Democratic members of Congress, underscoring the strong bipartisan support for Taiwan.</p><p>In China, however, Ms Tsai elicits hateful commentary on a level that perhaps only the Dalai Lama can match. Shortly after she visited a Los Angeles location of the Taiwanese coffee chain 85C, the Chinese internet erupted with anger, calling for a boycott of the chain’s several hundred locations in China, its largest market.</p><p>That day, 85C’s parent company, Gourmet Master, whose stock trades on Taiwan’s exchange, lost $120 million in share value. The company promptly apologised and expressed support for peaceful unification.</p><p>Many Taiwanese were upset by the company caving in to Chinese pressure, with some also calling for a boycott of the chain. Polls consistently show that the overwhelming majority of people in Taiwan, a multiparty democracy, oppose being absorbed into China’s one-party, authoritarian rule.</p><p>The episode is the latest example of the Chinese government using its grip on the country’s enormous market to pressure corporations into serving its political agenda. In recent months, companies including international airlines, hotels and other brands have begun referring to Taiwan as a province of China in response to threats from Beijing. The White House called China’s tactics “Orwellian nonsense,” but did little else to back up American corporations.</p><p>If China fines US companies or restricts their access to Chinese markets for refusing to call Taiwan a province, then the Trump administration should retaliate in kind against Chinese companies, said William Stanton, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial US diplomatic presence there.</p><p>“China’s trying to make both Taiwan and the government of Tsai Ing-wen persona non grata throughout the world,” he said. “There’s just no end to it.”</p><p>Bonnie Glaser, senior Asia adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Trump administration’s approval for Ms Tsai’s visits to the Reagan library and the Johnson Space Centre in Houston showed that “they trusted she would not say or do anything that would increase cross-strait tensions.”</p><p>Congress, which has been a staunch supporter of Taiwan since the United States broke formal ties almost four decades ago, has become increasingly open to taking a new approach toward Taiwan.</p><p>“I think at some point we’re going to have to recognise the independence of Taiwan,” Rep.

It was a mistake. Whether he misunderstood me or not he declared, with due menace, that any challenge to China’s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan would mean war. Apart from that, our meeting was a great success.</p><p>It was a very forceful reminder of just how sensitive an issue Taiwan is for the Chinese government. The very word “Taiwan” is guaranteed to bristle with any official as I, in my own small way, discovered.</p><p>Now Xi Jinping has once again raised the issue, on the 40th anniversary of a landmark “message to compatriots” that urged Taiwan to embark upon peaceful reunification. The president was conciliatory – but, as has long been the case, he refused to rule out military action if Beijing’s ambitions are rudely thwarted by a declaration of independence from Taiwan.</p><p>This matters more than most distant territorial scraps because it is part of a long list of Chinese geopolitical grievances. Though its support of Taiwan is far weaker than it used to be, America is still the guarantor of Taiwan’s security and is therefore a third party in the dispute. President Trump’s trade war with China (and a complex range of territorial waters disputes with, among others, the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia) also adds to the tensions, and they have started to fester and feed upon each other.</p><p>The obvious answer is for President Trump and President Xi to settle all these matters with a “grand bargain”. The outlines of this are already clear: the prize for Beijing is reunification, and the US should usher Taiwan towards reunification under the “one nation, two systems” model proposed by China. This model was broadly followed when Hong Kong and Macau were handed back by Britain and Portugal in the 1990s. It would be a fine thing for the Chinese president to present to his people on the 70th anniversary of the revolution this year.</p><p>In return, China should stop manipulating its currency and distorting its economy, and eliminate its still vast trade surplus with the US to trivial levels. It should also settle up its more outrageous claims to the seas around its coastline.</p><p>Chuck in some environmental initiatives (which would also level the economic playing field), a clampdown on intellectual property theft and some reduction in China’s neocolonial activities in Africa, and the world could be a much safer, more prosperous place. As Nixon and Henry Kissinger recognised half a century ago, it would also reset the balance of power away from the other global superpower, Russia.</p><p>With strong leaders – and Trump and Xi at least qualify as that – such a deal is surely possible. </p><p>Moreover, the Chinese claim to Taiwan is difficult to argue with. Taiwan is simply a post Cold War anomaly. China’s offer was perfectly clear and fair – especially if Taiwan is accepted to be part of China, as it has long been (and as the Taiwanese government once used to so violently insist). Xi said, for example: “On the basis of ensuring China’s sovereignty, security and interests of development, the social system and way of life in Taiwan will be fully respected, and the private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected after peaceful reunification is realised.”</p><p>More ominously, and as ever, there is a threat: “We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.”</p><p>Taiwan has soured relations between the west and Beijing since 1949, when Mao won the civil war and his opponents, the Kuomintang, fled to a few offshore islands, the largest of which was Taiwan, itself recently occupied by imperial Japan. It is rather as if a bunch of renegades in the English Civil War in the seventeenth century wound up on the Isle of Wight and declared themselves the sole legitimate government of the entire nation. Having failed in that quixotic enterprise, they now wish to declare themselves independent. That is, more or less, what is happening in Taiwan. It is getting a bit ridiculous, and it is maddening the Chinese government.</p><p>Increasingly anachronistic, Taiwan – even now formally known as the Republic of China – used to claim sovereignty over the entire nation, and was backed in its claim by a belligerent America. The US refused to recognise even the existence of “Red China” until president Richard Nixon, the former Cold War warrior, made his historic trip to the People’s Republic in 1972 and president Jimmy Carter normalised diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979. The PRC then also displaced Taiwan on the UN Security Council.</p><p>Since then, the Taiwanese have been slowly losing the diplomatic and, for that matter, the economic battle with a reforming, growing China. In the Mao era, China was an economic pygmy; today its economy is the largest in the world, if you remove the distortions of exchange rates. It is bigger than America and Germany combined, seven times bigger than Britain, and 20 times larger than Taiwan. The People’s Army has a million soldiers. It has 260 nuclear warheads. Diplomacy has to take some account of these towering realities. </p><p>The irony is that where once “Nationalist” Taiwan used to stress the unity of China and its claim of sovereignty over the entire territory, it is now Beijing that is anxious to reassert its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, while many Taiwanese want formal independence.</p><p>Referring to recent setbacks for her party, the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, now declares: “I must emphasise that the election results absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favours abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.” No – but they would like their economy to start growing again, and the obvious answer to that is economic reunification with the mainland.</p><p>The election of a female president in Taiwan in 2016 from a party that couldn’t have existed for most of Taiwan’s history in the one-party state run by the Kuomintang highlights the big new barrier to Chinese reunification. This is the second irony: this is no longer a tussle between opposing authoritarian ideologies – communist dictatorship China vs capitalist dictatorship China, as Taiwan is now a full democracy and China is no longer fully communist. It does feel bad to be abandoning a proper democracy such as Taiwan.</p><p>Yet China’s overwhelming military and economic superiority in the region does, indeed, as President Xi implies, mean that reunification is inevitable.</p><p>History proves that the most successful diplomatic initiatives, the ones that seem so bold and innovative at the time, are merely the acceptance of the inevitable: Nixon’s historic mission to China itself; the release of Nelson Mandela and a multi-racial South Africa; the existence of the state of Israel; the end of the British Empire and its transformation into a Commonwealth; the collapse of the USSR. These moments in history all required transforming a kind of defeat into a victory. Xi Jinping plainly sees this, and perhaps the authorities in Taiwan too. If only we could be confident that Trump is also willing to accept reality.</p><p>There seems to be a growing mood of hawkishness towards China in the US administration – a hostile speech by US vice president Mike Pence last year being a prominent example.

Twelfth-century ceramic arhats from Korea’s Goryeo kingdom look quizzically across a hall at Edo-era tea ware from Japan.</p><p>“It’s a global view of Asia,” said Wang Shih-Sheng, the museum’s chief curator. “Most of our artifacts come from our collection in Taipei, but when planning the project, we decided to look at things from an Asian perspective.”</p><p>The Taipei museum opened in 1965 and was used by Taiwan’s Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek as a source of local legitimacy vis-à-vis Mao’s Communists, the victors of the Chinese civil war. The museum was also employed as a tool for imposing a Chinese identity upon Taiwan residents.</p><p>Along with the Nationalists came more than 600,000 artifacts from the Palace Museum in Beijing, which was founded in 1925, the year after China’s last emperor, Puyi, who had not held the title of emperor since a short-lived restoration to the throne in 1917, was evicted from the Forbidden City. Before his expulsion, it became apparent that he and his court were selling off national treasures to survive.</p><p>Most of the items that survived the difficult voyage to Taiwan were produced by Chinese kingdoms and dynasties or nearby kingdoms, such as Tibet, who paid tribute to and traded with their Chinese neighbors.</p><p>Other items, however, came from further afield. Of little political use to the Nationalists, they took on a new significance after the election of Chen Shui- bian to the presidency of the Republic of China, as Taiwan has been called since 1945.</p><p>Mr. Chen was a member of the Democratic Progress Party, which sits at the center of the “pan-green” political camp in Taiwan’s politics that emphasizes Taiwan’s unique identity and prefers to keep the country self-determined. The party’s rise in the 2000 elections added a new voice to Taiwan’s identity politics in Taipei’s halls of power. By 2003, the idea of a new and very different branch of the National Palace Museum gained traction among pan-greens.</p><p>The man assigned to coordinate across ministries to establish the museum was Lin Sheng-Fong, who was Minister of State at the time and is now an associate professor of architecture at Shih Chien University in Taipei.</p><p>“There was a common belief that the Taipei Palace Museum had a huge collection and only a fraction of it was displayed,” Mr Lin said. “So we could create a second palace museum using the underdisplayed collection.”</p><p>Politicians in the sinocentric “pan-blue” camp that primarily includes the Nationalists were less enthusiastic, as were bureaucrats in the Taipei museum, Mr. Lin said. Deliberations concluded with Chiayi as the museum’s site and “Formosa in the great era of navigation” as its theme, he said.</p><p>A dispute with the initial architect, Antoine Predock, resulted in the stalling of the project. It restarted in 2010 with the involvement of the Taipei architect Kris Yao, who inherited a half-started project that presented several constraints, including an already-constructed shoreline on an artificial lake. Mr. Yao created a new design for the museum inspired by three primary strokes in Chinese calligraphy: one thick, one dry and one watery and smeared.</p><p>“It’s an abstraction of a very basic Chinese art translated into architecture,” Mr. Yao said.</p><p>The portion of the building representing the thick stroke contains the museum’s archive and exhibition area, which require minimal natural light to protect its contents. The dry stroke lets natural light in, and comprises the building’s exoskeleton, lobby and offices. The smeared stroke, embodying penetration, is composed of walking areas and the bridge that leads over the lake.</p><p>Inspired by his love of ancient Chinese bronzes, especially those of the Shang dynasty, Mr. Yao said he had digitized ancient dragon and cloud patterns for the scaly surface of the “thick stroke” portion of the building.</p><p>“It’s not a building, per se, it’s a form,” Mr. Yao said. “It sits on a totally green plain and is black and white.”</p><p>The museum’s prominence on Chiayi’s verdant coastal plain is a striking departure from the Taipei museum, a Chinese-style palace built into the side of a mountain. In his recent book “The Miraculous History of China’s Two Palace Museums,” the journalist Mark O’Neill wrote of Chiang’s demands for the National Palace Museum:</p><p>“The government wanted not only a traditional Chinese design that matched the art pieces inside but also a museum with the most modern conservation systems; it had to protect the pieces from earthquakes, typhoons, humidity, insects and air raids.”</p><p>A visit to the Taipei museum may leave visitors feeling adrift in the vast breadth of China’s geography and history. The Chiayi museum’s handful of exhibition rooms shrink both time and space, using Asia’s historical commercial and cultural exchanges, themselves often inseparable, to weave a regional patchwork that is neither exhaustive, nor exhausting. China’s important influence is not ignored, nor is it central to the museum.</p><p>Using the example of tea — a beverage that spread across ancient Asian trading routes — Ms. Wang expounded upon the shared differences of the museum’s exhibits.</p><p>“You can trace tea culture back to the Tang dynasty,” she said. “After arriving in other parts of Asia, it evolved because of local habits or culture,” with Tibetans adding yak butter or the Japanese grinding it to make matcha.</p><p>With the aim of creating the world’s top pan-Asian museum, Ms. Wang said the National Palace Museum would bring exhibitions in from other Asian collections around the world.</p><p>The ceramics hall, for example, currently displays Imari porcelain wares on loan from the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka. Future exhibitions will bring Japanese national treasures from the Tokyo National Museum and Kyushu National Museum, as well as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, she said.</p><p>Teresa Chiang, a Chiayi native visiting the museum with her parents and four-year-old daughter, said her first visit had left her feeling more connected to other Asian cultures. “At the Taipei museum you can’t enjoy Korean or Japanese culture,” she said. “Here you can see artifacts from all over Asia — I think it’s amazing.”</p>',NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/06/arts/06iht-RARTTAIWANa/06iht-RARTTAIWANa-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale','[\"170\", \"220\", \"79\"]',1,'一個以亞洲為中心的台灣博物館','null','在他最近出版的“中國兩座故宮的神奇歷史”一書中，記者馬克奧尼爾寫到了蔣介石對國立故宮博物館的要求：“政府不僅希望中國的傳統設計與藝術作品相匹配，而且還需要博物館擁有最現代化的保護系統;它必須保護碎片不受地震，颱風，濕度，昆蟲和空襲的影響。','<p>台灣嘉義縣 - 台灣有一個新的故宮博物院。這一次，它不僅僅與中國有關。 </p><p>由於台灣新政府希望淡化與中國的關係，同時與亞洲其他地區進行更多接觸，故宮殿博物館的南部分支機構反映了16年的政治變化以及隨之而來的台灣身份上升，並向市民敞開大門。 。 </p><p>與中國文化佔據中心地位的台北名不同，該博物館位於西南的嘉義縣，慶祝幾個世紀以來亞洲文化的相互聯繫和異花授粉。目前的展品採用的主題包括紡織品，陶瓷和茶等商品，以及佛教和伊斯蘭教的參考，以突出世界上人口最多的大陸的共同遺產。 </p><p>這件18世紀的綠色刺繡錦緞外套採用奧斯曼設計，中國面料和俄羅斯襯裡，掛在爪哇的圍裙和來自南亞的皇室服飾中。來自巴基斯坦的彌勒佛像與17世紀緬甸的青銅佛像相鄰。來自日本的江戶時代茶具大廳裡，來自韓國高麗王國的十二世紀陶瓷羅漢看起來很古怪。 </p><p> “這是對亞洲的全球觀點，”博物館首席策展人王世生說。 “我們的大部分文物來自台北的收藏品，但在規劃項目時，我們決定從亞洲的角度來看待事物。” </p><p>台北博物館於1965年開放，台灣民族主義政府在蔣介石的統治下，作為中國內戰勝利者毛澤東共產黨人的地方合法性來源。該博物館還被用作向台灣居民強加中國身份的工具。 </p><p>與國民黨一起出現了超過60萬件來自北京故宮博物院的文物，該博物館成立於1925年，也就是中國最後一位皇帝溥儀，也就是自1917年短暫修復王位以來沒有獲得過皇帝稱號的那一年。 ，被驅逐出紫禁城。在他被驅逐之前，很明顯他和他的法庭正在出售國寶以求生存。 </p><p>在艱難的台灣航行中倖存下來的大部分物品都是由中國王國，朝代或附近的王國（如西藏）生產的，他們向中國鄰國致敬和交易。 </p><p>然而，其他項目來自更遠的地方。自1945年台灣被任命以來，陳水扁當選為中華民國總統後，他們對民族主義者的政治用處微乎其微，具有了新的意義。 </p><p>陳先生是民主進步黨的成員，民主進步黨是台灣政治中“泛綠”政治陣營的中心，強調台灣的獨特身份，更喜歡讓國家自立。黨在2000年選舉中的崛起，為台灣的權力大廳中的台灣身份政治增添了新的聲音。到2003年，國立故宮博物館新建一個新的，非常不同的分支的想法在泛綠色植物中獲得了吸引力。 </p><p>被指派協調各部委建立博物館的人是林勝芳，他當時是國務部長，現在是台北世建大學建築學副教授。 </p><p> “人們普遍認為，台北故宮博物館藏品豐富，只展出了一小部分，”林先生說。 “因此，我們可以使用展示不足的藏品創建第二座宮殿博物館。” </p><p>林先生說，以中心為主的“泛藍”陣營的政治家，主要包括民族主義者，並不像台北博物館的官僚那樣熱情。他說，與嘉義作為博物館的網站以及“導航偉大時代的福爾摩沙”為主題進行了討論。 </p><p>與最初的建築師Antoine Predock發生爭執導致項目停滯不前。它在2010年由台北建築師Kris Yao的參與重新啟動，他繼承了一個半開始的項目，該項目提出了一些限制因素，包括人工湖上已建成的海岸線。姚先生為博物館創作了一個新設計，靈感來自中國書法的三個主要筆劃：一個厚，一個乾，一個水和塗抹。 </p><p> “這是一種非常基本的中國藝術的抽象，被翻譯成建築，”姚先生說。 </p><p>建築物的部分代表厚厚的筆劃，包含博物館的檔案和展覽區域，需要最少的自然光來保護其內容。乾燥的行程讓自然光進入，包括建築物的外骨骼，大廳和辦公室。塗抹的中風，體現穿透力，由步行區和通過湖的橋樑組成。 </p><p>受到他對古代中國青銅器的熱愛，特別是商代的青銅器的影響，姚先生說他已經將古代龍和雲圖案數字化為建築物“厚中風”部分的鱗片狀表面。 </p><p> “這不是一座建築，本身就是一種形式，”姚先生說。 “它坐落在一個完全綠色的平原上，是黑色和白色。” </p><p>博物館在嘉義蜿蜒的沿海平原上的突出地位遠離台北博物館，這是一座建在山邊的中國式宮殿。在他最近出版的“中國兩座故宮的神奇歷史”一書中，記者馬克奧尼爾寫到了蔣介石對國立故宮的要求： </p><p> “政府不僅希望傳統的中國設計與藝術作品相匹配，還希望博物館擁有最現代化的保護系統;它必須保護這些碎片不受地震，颱風，濕度，昆蟲和空襲的影響。“ </p><p>參觀台北博物館可能會讓遊客在中國廣闊的地理和歷史中感到徘徊。嘉義博物館的少數幾個展覽廳縮短了時間和空間，利用亞洲歷史悠久的商業和文化交流，這些交流本身往往是不可分割的，編織出一個既不詳盡又不費力的區域拼湊。中國的重要影響力不容忽視，也不是博物館的核心。 </p><p>以王茶為例，這是一種遍布古代亞洲貿易路線的飲料 - 王女士闡述了博物館展品的共同差異。 </p><p> “你可以將茶文化追溯到唐朝，”她說。 “抵達亞洲其他地區後，由於當地的習慣或文化而進化，”西藏人加入犛牛油或日本人研磨它來製作抹茶。 </p><p>王女士表示，為了打造世界頂級的汎亞博物館，國立故宮博物院將在世界各地的其他亞洲館藏展覽。 </p><p>例如，陶瓷大廳目前從大阪東方陶瓷博物館借用伊万裡瓷器。她說，未來的展覽將帶來東京國立博物館和九州國立博物館以及舊金山亞洲藝術博物館的日本國寶。 </p><p>來自嘉義的Teresa Chiang與她的父母和四歲的女兒一起參觀博物館，她說，她的第一次訪問讓她感覺與其他亞洲文化有更多聯繫。 “在台北博物館，你無法享受韓國或日本文化，”她說。 “在這裡你可以看到來自亞洲各地的文物 - 我覺得它太棒了。” </p>'),(156,7,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/business/international/taiwan-semiconductor-china-factory-chips.html','Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to Open Own Plant in China','null','In a nod to concerns about advanced chip protection technology being leaked to Chinese competitors, Taiwan Semiconductor said in a separate statement that by the time the facility in China is up and running, an advanced operation in Taiwan would be churning out chips a generation more sophisticated.',' Paul Mozur','2015-12-07',1449446400000,'<p>As many of its competitors in the chip industry form partnerships in China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said on Monday that it was taking a different route: setting up a new manufacturing plant without help from a local partner.</p><p>The move is designed to protect its technology while playing to a China market brimming with makers of inexpensive smartphones.

Visit the popular Tamsui district and you may catch a glimpse of the company’s gleaming new $22 million home, which opened in April. If you travel on China Airlines, Taiwan’s flagship carrier, you may even fly on the Cloud Gate Liveried Aircraft, adorned with dancers’ likenesses. The airline unveiled it last year, saying the troupe represented the “pinnacle of Taiwan culture.”</p><p>Founded in 1973, Cloud Gate was Taiwan’s first professional dance company. Forty-two years later, it has become a roving, bounding symbol of this island. On Wednesday, it will open the annual Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the United States premiere of a 2013 work, “Rice.” The visit, with performances through Saturday, will be its sixth to the academy, and its first stop on a tour that will include performances in Los Angeles (January) and Washington (February). The company moves on to Paris in the spring.</p><p>Promoting Taiwan’s image abroad is a responsibility that Cloud Gate’s founder, artistic director and chief choreographer, Lin Hwai-Min, 68, does not take lightly.</p><p>“He’s a very public figure,” said Yatin Lin (no relation), a professor of dance studies at Taipei National University of the Arts. “Because of the political situation with mainland China, it’s very difficult for our political leaders to be active abroad, so many people see him as not just an artist but as a kind of cultural ambassador for Taiwan.”</p><p>This month, that commitment was on display as the choreographer marched into the rehearsal theater at the company’s new complex, clad in his signature uniform (black T-shirt, black pants) and brandishing a black backpack and a pack of cigarettes. While he settled at a table facing the stage, the company’s 22 dancers readied themselves for their first full run-through of “Rice” in a month.</p><p>As the music — a compilation of Hakka folk songs, drumming and Western classical music — began, a lone dancer strode out holding a long, quivering rattan stick. In the next 70 minutes, the dancers stamped, leapt and folded and unfolded their bodies in a demonstration of Cloud Gate’s hybrid aesthetic, which combines Western classical dance techniques with Eastern “rounded” movements that draw on martial arts and tai chi. Missing from the run-through was the production’s backdrop, a sumptuous video filmed on location over a cycle of rice cultivation in Chihshang in southeastern Taiwan.</p><p>Mr. Lin sat mostly silent, scribbling notes and only intermittently shouting (“Don’t rush, don’t rush!” and “Breathe!”). After the dancers took their final, choreographed bows, he stood and went through his notes, working with individuals on minor tweaks. The rehearsal had gone well and now the dancers just needed to focus on taking care of their bodies for the coming season, he told them later as they sat around him on the stage, stretching and massaging their muscles with foam rollers.</p><p>Later, in the company’s offices, Mr. Lin talked about the obligations he felt toward the dancers and society.</p><p>“I often remind the dancers that when they are onstage, they are often the only Taiwanese people that a lot of people get to see that are actually labeled as Taiwanese,” he said.</p><p>Much has changed since Mr. Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947. Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang’s National Revolutionary Army fled here in 1949 after losing the civil war to Mao’s Chinese Communists. The Kuomintang ruled Taiwan with an authoritarian hand for decades until 1996, when Taiwanese voters elected their president for the first time. Taiwan has been considered a democracy ever since (and may elect its first female president in January), but the island remains a disputed territory.</p><p>Growing up as the oldest of five children, Mr. Lin nurtured multiple passions, for politics, writing and dance. Only years later, while a student at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, did he decide to pursue choreography. He had spent two summers in New York studying dance at the Martha Graham School, and after completing his degree at Iowa he returned to Taiwan, and soon started Cloud Gate.</p><p>The company’s birth came just two years after what Mr. Lin, like many other Taiwanese, sees as a defining moment in the nation’s recent political history: the 1971 resolution that displaced the government in Taipei as the representative of China at the United Nations in favor of the government in Beijing.</p><p>“When I started the company I said, ‘Composed by Chinese, choreographed by Chinese, danced by Chinese, for a Chinese audience,’ ” said Mr. Lin, whose family has lived in Taiwan for generations. “Then Taiwan was kicked out of the U.N. and all of a sudden I had to figure out who I was.”</p><p>The event inspired “Legacy” (1978), which portrayed the early history of Taiwan. It was followed by such works as “Songs of the Wanderers,” “Moon Water” and the “Cursive” trilogy.</p><p>Reviews of Cloud Gate’s performances in the United States have been mixed. Critics have lauded the company\'s East-meets-West approach, with Anna Kisselgoff writing in The New York Times in 2003 that “Moon Water” was a “work unlike any other.” But Alastair Macaulay of The Times wrote in 2011 that the works were “repetitive” and called “Water Stains on the Wall” “devoid of lightness and humor.”</p><p>As the company’s stature grew, so too did the modern dance scene in Taiwan.</p><p>“Before Cloud Gate, there wasn’t even such thing as a wuzhe,” said Ping Heng, 57, the founder and artistic director of Dance Forum Taipei, using the term for dancer. “Before, people thought dancing was something you could do in school, but it wasn’t something worthy of being a profession. They just called dancers ‘tiaowu de ren,’ ” literally, people who dance.</p><p>Lin Lee-Chen, 65, the founder and artistic director of the Legend Lin Dance Theater in Taipei, said, “The dance scene in Taiwan today is very diverse,” with dance companies “of all sizes and styles.”</p><p>When asked about his possible retirement, Mr. Lin of Cloud Gate was reluctant to comment. But he acknowledged that the company’s new complex, which he said would allow his troupe and other dance and theatrical ventures to perpetuate the “Cloud Gate energy,” would make it easier for him to step away.</p><p>Still, “I don’t want any statues,” he said. “I’m a Buddhist. I think everything is just illusory, especially for dancers.</p><p>“We know that dance happens, but it also vanishes when it happens,” he said. “All we are creating is air. We are giving society a different air, that’s all.”</p>',NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/15/arts/15CLOUDGATE-FLOATER/15CLOUDGATE-FLOATER-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale','[\"3\", \"123\", \"254\"]',2,'雲門舞劇院：台灣的流動，象徵','null','台灣新台北 - 台灣大多數人可能都知道島上最傑出的表演團體雲門舞劇院，即使他們對現代舞沒有興趣。','<p>台灣新台北 - 台灣大多數人可能都知道島上最傑出的表演團體雲門舞劇院，即使他們對現代舞沒有興趣。 </p><p>在這裡搭乘公共汽車或地鐵，您可以看到兩側印有劇團舞者的照片。訪問受歡迎的淡水區，您可以一睹該公司4月份開業的2200萬美元新房屋。如果您乘坐檯灣旗艦航空公司中國航空公司（China Airlines）旅行，您甚至可以搭乘雲門飛行器（Cloud Gate Liveried Aircraft），裝飾著舞者的肖像。該航空公司去年公佈了這一說法，稱該劇團代表了“台灣文化的巔峰”。 </p><p>雲門成立於1973年，是台灣第一家專業舞蹈公司。四十二年後，它已成為這個島嶼的流動，有界的象徵。星期三，它將在布魯克林音樂學院舉辦一年一度的下一波音樂節，並將在美國首映2013年作品“賴斯”。這次訪問將在周六舉行，將是該學院的第六次，也是第一次參加巡迴演出，包括洛杉磯（1月）和華盛頓（2月）的演出。該公司在春季前往巴黎。 </p><p>提升台灣在海外的形像是雲門的創始人，藝術總監兼首席編舞，68歲的林懷民的責任。 </p><p> “他是一個非常公開的人物，”台北國立藝術大學舞蹈研究教授Yatin Lin（無關係）說。 “由於中國大陸的政治局勢，我們的政治領導人很難在海外活動，所以很多人認為他不僅僅是一位藝術家，而且還是一種台灣文化大使。” </p><p>本月，當這位舞蹈指導進入公司新建築的排練劇場時，展示了這一承諾，穿著他的標誌性制服（黑色T卹，黑色褲子），揮舞著黑色背包和一包香煙。當他在一張面向舞台的桌子上安頓下來時，該公司的22名舞者準備在一個月內完成他們的第一次完整的“賴斯”演出。 </p><p>隨著音樂 - 客家民歌，鼓聲和西方古典音樂的彙編 - 開始，一個孤獨的舞者大步走出一個長而顫抖的藤條。在接下來的70分鐘裡，舞者們在雲門的混合美學展示中鐫刻，跳躍，折疊和展開他們的身體，結合了西方古典舞蹈技巧和東方“圓潤”運動，吸取武術和太極拳。在播出期間遺失的是製作的背景，在台灣東南部池上的一個水稻種植週期拍攝的一個豐富的視頻。 </p><p>林先生大部分都是沉默的，塗鴉的筆記，只是間歇地大喊（“不要急，不要急！”和“呼吸！”）。在舞者們拿出他們最後的，精心編排的弓箭之後，他站起來並經歷了他的筆記，與個人一起進行了微小的調整。排練進展順利，現在舞者們需要專注於為即將到來的賽季照顧他們的身體，他們後來告訴他們，他們坐在舞台上，用泡沫輥拉伸和按摩他們的肌肉。 </p><p>後來，在公司的辦公室裡，林先生談到了他對舞者和社會的義務。 </p><p> “我經常提醒舞者，當他們在舞台上時，他們往往是很多人看到的唯一被認為是台灣人的台灣人，”他說。 </p><p>自1947年林先生出生於台灣以來，情況發生了很大的變化。蔣介石和國民黨的國民革命軍在1949年中國共產黨失去內戰後逃到了這裡。幾十年來，國民黨以專制的手段統治台灣，直到1996年台灣選民第一次當選總統。從那以後台灣一直被認為是一個民主國家（並且可能在1月份選出第一位女性總統），但該島仍然是一個有爭議的領土。 </p><p>作為五個孩子中最年長的孩子，林先生培養了多種激情，包括政治，寫作和舞蹈。僅僅幾年之後，在愛荷華大學作家工作室的一名學生，他決定追求編舞。他在紐約度過了兩個夏天，在瑪莎格雷厄姆學校學習舞蹈，在愛荷華州完成學位後，他回到台灣，很快就開始了雲門。 </p><p>公司誕生僅僅兩年之後，林先生和許多其他台灣人一樣，認為這是國家近期政治史上的一個決定性時刻：1971年的決議取代台北政府作為中國在聯合國的代表贊成北京政府</p><p> “當我開辦公司時，我說，&#39;由中國人編排，由中國人編排，中國人為中國觀眾跳舞&#39;，”林先生說，他的家人已經在台灣生活了好幾代。 “然後台灣被趕出了聯合國，我突然想知道我是誰。” </p><p>該活動啟發了“遺產”（1978），描繪了台灣的早期歷史。隨後是“流浪者之歌”，“月亮之水”和“草書”三部曲等作品。 </p><p> Cloud Gate在美國的表現評論參差不齊。評論家們讚揚了公司的東西方式，安娜·基塞爾戈夫在2003年的“紐約時報”上寫道，“月亮水”是一部“與眾不同的作品”。但是，“泰晤士報”的阿拉斯泰爾麥考利在2011年寫道，作品是“重複”，並稱為“牆上的水漬”“缺乏輕盈和幽默。” </p><p>隨著公司的地位越來越高，台灣的現代舞蹈場景也越來越多。 </p><p> “在雲之門之前，甚至沒有像武茲這樣的東西，”台灣舞蹈論壇的創始人兼藝術總監，57歲的平衡用舞者這個詞來說。 “以前，人們認為跳舞是你在學校可以做的事情，但這不是一個值得做的事情。他們只是稱舞者&#39;towowu de ren&#39;，“字面意思是跳舞的人。 </p><p> 65歲的Lin Lee-Chen是台北林瑞傳奇舞蹈劇院的創始人兼藝術總監，他說，“今天台灣的舞蹈場景非常多樣化”，舞蹈公司“各種規模和風格”。 </p><p>當被問及他可能退休時，雲門的林先生不願發表評論。但他承認，該公司的新綜合體，他說將允許他的劇團和其他舞蹈和戲劇企業使“雲門能量”永久化，這將使他更容易離開。 </p><p>他說，“我不想要任何雕像。” “我是佛教徒。我認為一切都只是虛幻的，特別是對舞者而言。 </p><p> “我們知道舞蹈會發生，但它會在它發生時消失，”他說。 “我們所創造的只是空氣。我們給社會一個不同的空氣，就是這樣。“ </p>'),(158,7,'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/asia/xi-jinping-taiwan-china.html','Xi Jinping Warns Taiwan That Unification Is the Goal and Force Is an Option','null','BEIJING — China’s president, Xi Jinping, warned Taiwan that unification must be the ultimate goal of any talks over its future and that efforts to assert full independence could be met by armed force, laying out an unyielding position on Wednesday in his first major speech about the contested island democracy.',' Chris Buckley and Chris Horton','2019-01-01',1546300800000,'<p>BEIJING — China’s president, Xi Jinping, warned Taiwan that unification must be the ultimate goal of any talks over its future and that efforts to assert full independence could be met by armed force, laying out an unyielding position on Wednesday in his first major speech about the contested island democracy.</p><p>Mr. Xi outlined his stance one day after Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, urged China to peacefully settle disputes over the island, whose 23 million people, she said, want to preserve their self-rule.

Many Taiwanese, though, bridle at Beijing using its growing influence to isolate them from international participation, and to press them toward eventually accepting Chinese sovereignty over the island.</p><p>Since coming to power in late 2012, Mr. Xi has warned Taiwan against any shift toward independence and repeatedly met with Taiwanese politicians from the Kuomintang, the party that ruled China before the Communist Party and that now favors closer ties with Beijing.

Glaser, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>“My initial impression is that the speech is a reaffirmation of current policy,” Ms. Glaser said. She also noted that despite Mr. Xi’s renewed call for unification, he did not set a deadline. “It is notable that there is no mention of a timetable or deadline for reunification — it is just a goal,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Xi indicated that China’s multipronged pressure on Taiwan is likely to persist after Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which is wary of moving closer to China, suffered stinging setbacks in local Taiwanese elections in November.

Tensions have resurged since the 1990s, when Taiwan became a democracy and many voters on the island turned to politicians who argue that Taiwan should keep China at a distance, or even assert outright independence.</p><p>Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party has been at the forefront of those independence-leaning views, and after she won power, China quickly cut high-level contacts, arguing that Ms. Tsai had failed to acknowledge that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.</p><p>In the past three years, China has accelerated efforts to peel away countries from the list of those that give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Last spring, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso established ties with China, and in August, El Salvador cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan, leaving 17 nations that maintain their diplomatic allegiance with the island.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech commemorated the 40 years since China laid out a new approach to Taiwan soon after the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing at the start of 1979.

But his proposal appeared unlikely to win over residents of the self-ruled island, who have seen Hong Kong’s freedoms in rapid retreat under a similar deal.</p><p>Mr. Xi stressed how vital unification with Taiwan is to his vision of Chinese national rejuvenation in his first major speech about the disputed island. The Chinese Communist Party regards Taiwan, a lively democracy, as a historical mistake — a piece of territory that should never have gained autonomy from China. And as an ardent patriot, Mr. Xi finds Taiwan’s separate status especially galling.</p><p>Mr. Xi did not lay down a timetable for absorbing Taiwan, which is something more hawkish voices in Beijing have urged. But as he nears his seventh year as president, he indicated that his patience had limits and that he wanted to bring Taiwan into ever-closer political, economic and cultural orbit around China.</p><p>“That the two sides of the strait are still not fully unified is a wound to the Chinese nation left by history,” Mr. Xi said in his direction-setting speech in the Great Hall of the People. The political divisions between China and Taiwan, he added “cannot be passed on from generation to generation.”</p><p>But even laced with this sense of urgency, Mr. Xi’s recipe for bringing Taiwan closer to absorption into “one China” appeared unlikely to win over many on the island, even after its president, Tsai Ing-wen — openly loathed by Beijing — suffered bruising electoral losses in November.</p><p>On the one hand, Mr. Xi threatened military force if Taiwanese leaders grasped for independence. On the other hand, Mr. Xi said that if Taiwan were to agree to unification, its rights would be ensured by the “one country, two systems” framework that Beijing used in Hong Kong after it returned from British colonial control in 1997.</p><p>But neither the threat nor the promised reward seemed likely to sharply weaken Taiwanese opposition to China’s demands, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University who studies relations between China and Taiwan.</p><p>“Xi Jinping’s approach is to use a bigger stick and to make the carrot sweeter,” he said in a telephone interview. But having seen Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms squeezed by Beijing in recent years, many Taiwanese people were likely to be suspicious of Mr. Xi’s offers, he said.</p><p>Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed legal autonomy since it returned to Chinese sovereignty, and residents of the city still have much wider freedoms than citizens in the rest of China. But publishing, news media and pro-democratic activism in Hong Kong have retreated in recent years, reflecting the growing weight of Chinese political pressures.</p><p>Virtually no section of the electorate in Taiwan would find “one country, two systems” an attractive goal, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain who studies the island’s politics. “Taiwan is not a colony à la Hong Kong, and it has everything to lose and nothing to gain from agreeing to it,” Professor Sullivan said.</p><p>Even so, Mr. Xi had political motives to show that he was working to absorb Taiwan, Professor Sullivan said. “Having unification as a national aspiration is incredibly useful for the Chinese Communist Party, which stakes its legitimacy on economic growth and nationalism,” he said. “The former is becoming more difficult to deliver, and so the latter becomes more important.”</p><p>Few experts believe that Mr. Xi’s speech augured an eruption of conflict over Taiwan. But tensions could rise, especially as his speech jarred so much with comments from Ms. Tsai.</p><p>Taiwan and China have been at loggerheads, sometimes close to full-scale war, since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated by Mao Zedong’s revolutionary armies retreated to the island. But Beijing’s fears that Taiwan could embrace full independence have grown only since the 1990s, when the island moved to democratic elections that brought to life parties that rejected Chinese identity.</p><p>“Tsai and Xi are sticking to their positions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is little reason to expect any improvement in cross-strait ties as a result of these major statements. But there is also little reason to expect a crisis.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech marked 40 years since China set out a new approach to unification with Taiwan soon after the United States shifted diplomatic ties from the Republic of China — the name for the government on the island — to the communist government in Beijing.</p><p>But in a speech on Monday, Ms. Tsai said Taiwan’s 23 million people wanted to maintain their self-rule, and she warned against reading the recent setbacks of her Democratic Progressive Party as a rejection of that principle. In November, the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities.</p><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Tsai promptly rejected “one country, two systems” as a basis for negotiations.</p><p>“Here I must reiterate that Taiwan will never accept ‘one country, two systems,’ ” she told reporters in Taipei, the capital of the island, in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “Democracy is a value and lifestyle cherished by the Taiwanese people.”</p><p>The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected Mr. Xi’s proposal. It said in an emailed comment that the Chinese government had already “gravely wrecked Hong Kong, that window into ‘one country, two systems.’ ”</p><p>Mr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification.</p><p>But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China’s political goals.</p><p>“Compatriots on both sides of the strait are a family,” he said. “With the one-China principle as a bedrock, there are no obstacles to any political party or group on Taiwan interacting with us.”</p><p>The Chinese government was willing to open discussions with politicians and representatives from Taiwan, so long as they opposed independence for the island and accepted Beijing’s formula for “one China,” Mr. Xi said. He also held out greater access to China’s vast and growing economy. China already accounts for over 30 percent of Taiwan’s trade, and the promised links could appeal to some Taiwanese cities looking to speed growth.</p><p>Jason Hsu, a Taiwanese legislator who belongs to the Kuomintang, said Taiwanese voters were not likely to be directly influenced by Chinese overtures but were concerned about economic prosperity.</p><p>“Most Taiwanese voters are in the middle,” he said. “They care more about prosperity and managing the cross-strait relationship.”</p><p>Analysts saw parallels between Mr. Xi’s proposals and the “united front” tactics that the Chinese Communist Party has evolved to divide, tame and co-opt potential opponents in China, Hong Kong and increasingly abroad.</p><p>“Behind the speech there is a clear intention, which is to intensify the united front work, to multiply the connections and bonds of dependence upon mainland China,” said Professor Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. “For someone who lives in Hong Kong, there are a lot of echoes of what’s happened here.”</p><p>Still, Taiwan’s diverse electorate, economy and politics made it much more difficult for China’s divide-and-control approach to succeed there, he said. Ms. Tsai said she would oppose any Chinese efforts to shape Taiwan’s decisions by recruiting support from local politicians and groups.</p><p>“There must not be meddling in the Taiwanese people’s elections through creating divisions and lures,” Ms. Tsai said in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “It must be the government, or a public authority authorized by the government, that sits down for any talks.”</p>',NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/world/03china-taiwan-1-print/merlin_148671144_2ec719ff-6236-43ec-977c-7abf08efcfd3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale','[\"306\", \"131\", \"399\"]',1,'來自中國的統一計劃在台灣找到了很少的人','null','習近平的講話標誌著中國在美國從中華民國 - 島上政府的名義 - 與北京的共產黨政府建立外交關係後不久與台灣實現統一的新方法已有40年。','<p>北京 - 習近平主席週三表示，他希望中國在數十年的時間裡取得進展，以贏得對台灣的控制權。但他的建議似乎不太可能贏得這個自治島嶼的居民，他們看到香港的自由在類似協議下迅速撤退。 </p><p>習近平強調，在他關於爭議島嶼的第一次重要講話中，與台灣統一的重要性在於他對中國民族復興的看法。中國共產黨認為台灣是一個活躍的民主國家，是一個歷史性的錯誤 - 一塊永遠不會從中國獲得自治權的領土。作為一個熱心的愛國者，習近平發現台灣的獨立地位特別令人痛苦。 </p><p>習近平沒有製定吸收台灣的時間表，這是北京一些更強硬的聲音所敦促的。但當他接近擔任總統的第七年時，他表示他的耐心有限，他希望將台灣帶入中國更近的政治，經濟和文化軌道。 </p><p>習近平在人民大會堂發表講話時說：“海峽兩岸尚未完全統一，是歷史留下的中華民族的傷口。”他說，中國和台灣之間的政治分歧“不能代代相傳”。 </p><p>但即使在台灣總統蔡英文公開憎恨北京之後，習近平將台灣拉近吸收“一個中國”的秘訣也不太可能贏得島上許多人的支持。 11月選舉失利慘淡。 </p><p>一方面，如果台灣領導人抓住獨立，習近平就會威脅軍事力量。另一方面，習近平表示，如果台灣同意統一，那麼北京在1997年從英國殖民統治下回歸後在香港使用的“一國兩制”框架將確保其權利。 </p><p>研究中國與台灣關係的香港浸會大學政治學教授讓 - 皮埃爾卡貝斯坦說，但威脅和承諾的獎勵似乎都不會大幅削弱台灣人對中國要求的反對意見。 </p><p>他在接受電話採訪時說：“習近平的方法是用更大的棍子，使胡蘿蔔更甜。”但他說，近年來，由於看到香港的自治和自由受到北京的擠壓，許多台灣人可能會對習近平的提議表示懷疑。 </p><p>在“一國兩制”框架下，香港恢復中國主權後享有法律自治權，而中國居民的自由仍比中國其他地區的居民寬鬆得多。但近年來香港的出版，新聞媒體和民主活動已經退去，反映出中國政治壓力越來越大。 </p><p>研究台灣政治的英國諾丁漢大學副教授喬納森沙利文表示，台灣選民中幾乎沒有任何一部分會發現“一國兩制”是一個有吸引力的目標。沙利文教授說：“台灣不是香港的殖民地，它有一切都會失去，並且無需同意。” </p><p>沙利文教授說，即便如此，習近平還是有政治動機表明他正在努力吸收台灣。他說：“統一作為一個國家的願望，對中國共產黨來說是非常有用的，中國共產黨在經濟增長和民族主義方面具有合法性。” “前者越來越難以實現，後者變得更加重要。” </p><p>很少有專家認為，習近平的講話預示著台灣衝突的爆發。但緊張局勢可能會上升，尤其是在蔡女士發表評論時，他的講話非常激烈。 </p><p>自1949年國民黨軍隊擊敗毛澤東的革命軍隊撤退到台灣以來，台灣和中國一直處於爭執之中，有時甚至接近全面戰爭。但是，自20世紀90年代以來，北京一直擔心台灣可以接受完全獨立，這個島嶼正在進行民主選舉，這些民主選舉使生活黨拒絕了中國人的身份。 </p><p>華盛頓戰略與國際研究中心中國電力項目主任邦尼·格拉澤說：“蔡和習都堅持自己的立場。” “由於這些重大聲明，沒有理由期待兩岸關係有任何改善。但也沒有理由期待危機。“ </p><p>習近平的講話標誌著中國在美國從中華民國 - 島上政府的名義 - 與北京的共產黨政府建立外交關係後不久與台灣實現統一的新方法已有40年。 </p><p>但在周一的一次演講中，蔡女士表示，台灣2300萬人希望維持自治，她警告說，不要將民主進步黨最近的挫折視為拒絕這一原則。 11月，支持與中國建立更緊密關係的反對黨國民黨贏得了台灣三個人口最多的城市的市長。 </p><p>週二，蔡女士立即拒絕“一國兩制”作為談判的基礎。 </p><p> “在這裡，我必須重申台灣永遠不會接受&#39;一國兩制&#39;，”她在台灣首都台北對記者的講話回應記者。 “民主是台灣人民珍視的價值和生活方式。” </p><p>台灣外交部也駁回了習近平的提議。它在一封電子郵件中表示，中國政府已經“嚴重破壞了香港，這個窗口進入&#39;一國兩制&#39;。” “ </p><p>習近平將台灣人描述為普遍贊成與中國統一。但去年8月國立政治大學發布的一項調查顯示，只有3％的台灣受訪者表示他們現在需要統一。另有12.5％的人表示他們更喜歡現狀和最終的統一。 </p><p>但在他的演講中，習近平表示，他願意為了中國的政治目標，在台灣獲得接受，即使不支持，也願意進行長期的比賽。 </p><p> “海峽兩岸的同胞是一個家庭，”他說。 “以一個中國原則為基石，台灣任何政黨或團體與我們互動都沒有障礙。” </p><p>習近平表示，中國政府願意與台灣的政治家和代表進行討論，只要他們反對島內的獨立，並接受北京的“一個中國”的方案。他還為中國龐大且不斷發展的經濟提供了更多機會。中國已佔台灣貿易的30％以上，承諾的聯繫可能會吸引一些希望加速增長的台灣城市。 </p><p>屬於國民黨的台灣立法委員Jason Hsu表示，台灣選民不太可能受到中國提議的直接影響，但擔心經濟繁榮。 </p><p> “大多數台灣選民都在中間，”他說。 “他們更關心繁榮和管理兩岸關係。” </p><p>分析人士看到習近平的提議與中國共產黨已經演變為在中國，香港以及越來越多國外分裂，馴服和共同選擇潛在對手的“統一戰線”戰術之間的相似之處。 </p><p>香港浸會大學的卡貝斯坦教授說：“在演講的背後，有一個明確的意圖，即加強統一戰線的工作，增加對中國大陸的依賴關係和聯繫。” “對於居住在香港的人來說，這裡發生的事情有許多迴響。” </p><p>他說，儘管如此，台灣的選民，經濟和政治多元化使得中國的分治方法更難以在那裡取得成功。蔡女士表示，她將反對中國通過招募當地政治家和團體支持來製定台灣決策的任何努力。 </p><p> “她不應該通過製造分歧和誘惑來干預台灣人民的選舉，”蔡女士在回應習近平的講話時說。 “政府或政府授權的公共機構必須為任何談判做好準備。” </p>'),(160,7,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/opinion/taiwans-president-caves-in-to-china.html','Taiwan’s President Caves In to China','null','Ma’s attempts at economic rapprochement with China that have largely led to disaffection with not only the KMT but the entire political process in Taiwan.',' Wu’er Kaixi','2015-11-06',1446768000000,'<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The “historic” meeting that is to take place in Singapore on Saturday between the leaders of China and Taiwan is nothing to cheer about. There will be no progress in terms of peace and reconciliation. The world will witness nothing but politics at its most cynical.</p><p>This is to be expected of the president of China, Xi Jinping, who has put the world into a swoon with his economic diplomacy while persecuting dissent and freedom of speech at home, systematically arresting human-rights lawyers and parading a Stalinesque purge of his political enemies as a crackdown on corruption. In this sense, he might even be excused for pretending to make history. It is simply his job, and he is answerable to no one.</p><p>Taiwan’s elected president, Ma Ying-jeou, on the other hand, cannot be excused. Unlike Mr. Xi, he is accountable to the people of Taiwan who elected him.</p><p>Relations between China and Taiwan have been tense since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek lost a civil war to Mao Zedong’s Communist forces and retreated to the island with his troops. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province, while Taiwanese views of the mainland have evolved over the decades. Mr. Ma was elected in 2008 after a campaign calling for more trade and warmer relations with the mainland, but the sense now is that he’s gone too far.</p><p>In the run-up to the 2012 elections that ushered him into his second and last term as president, Mr. Ma said there was “no way” he would meet with the leadership of China. The Taiwanese are rightfully anxious about the economic and military rise of China and have given up on finding any common ground for discussion with China on Beijing’s primary — in fact, only — goal: reunification.</p><p>Why then, just two months ahead of presidential and legislative elections, would Mr. Ma backtrack and agree to dine with the one man who presents the greatest threat to Taiwan’s democratic and open society?</p><p>The answer is simple. Mr. Ma knows that his party, the Kuomintang, or KMT, is very likely to not only lose the presidency on Jan. 16, but also, in a historical first, lose control of Parliament, putting power in the hands of politicians better attuned to voters’ anti-reunification sentiments. Both Mr. Ma and his counterpart in China are desperate to make a last-minute deal that would give the KMT a fighting chance to retain its grip on Taiwan’s legislature.</p><p>It is not wild speculation to conclude that the only circumstances under which the meeting between Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi could possibly have come about is one in which Mr. Xi offers a concession to Taiwan’s departing president in the hope that it leads to continued KMT control of Taiwan.</p><p>If Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi were particularly smart — and recent history provides no guarantee of that — they may have agreed that Mr. Xi will make a grand gesture, such as an offer to withdraw the missiles that currently threaten Taiwan, in return for a continuation of the status quo with movement toward closer relations. The logic would be that a grand gesture like this would resonate with a nervous Taiwan electorate and could even reshape the electoral landscape.</p><p>Alternatively, Mr. Xi might offer Taiwan even closer economic ties and a role in China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which so far has been denied Taiwan. But this would fail and only push the Taiwanese electorate further into the camp of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which holds a strong lead in polls.</p><p>The Taiwanese have increasingly come to see closer economic ties with China as a threat to their political and cultural autonomy. In fact, it has been Mr. Ma’s attempts at economic rapprochement with China that have largely led to disaffection with not only the KMT but the entire political process in Taiwan. This has been a significant factor in the rise of independent parties, student protests and increased identity politics.</p><p>But let us imagine that the two leaders make the smartest of possible moves, and Mr. Xi offers Taiwan a concession — such as removal of the missiles just across the narrow Taiwan Strait — that wins the KMT some of those elusive parliamentary seats.</p><p>It would be a victory for Mr. Xi and for Mr. Ma — particularly if the KMT were able to hold on to Parliament. The presidential duo could package it to the international community as a major stride toward peace and reconciliation. Western columnists would rub their hands in glee and write in adulatory terms of China and Taiwan’s push for peace in a strife-riddled world.</p><p>Nevertheless, the truth will remain that whatever happens on Saturday in Singapore is nothing more than cynical politics — cynical politics that come at a huge cost for Taiwan.

Tensions rose in the volatile region in recent weeks, after India conducted a “pre-emptive strike” in Pakistan-controlled territory, and Pakistan captured an Indian fighter pilot.

True Dragon Tower is owned by Lung Yen Life Service, a Taiwan-listed company that is the third-largest funeral services operator in the world by market capitalization. After a decade of construction, the tower finally opened for business in 2002. Its soaring height was, in part, a response to the rapidly increasing rate of cremation in Taiwan. In the 1950s (pdf, link in Chinese), the Taiwanese government promoted it instead of ground burials in anticipation of a space crunch in the future, said the spokeswoman for Lung Yen. Well over 90% of people in Taiwan are now cremated, a rate similar to that of other developed places in Asia such as Japan and Hong Kong.</p><p>People over 65 currently account for more than 14% of Taiwan’s population of 23.6 million, fitting the World Health Organization’s definition of an aged society. According to government projections, Taiwan’s population will peak in 2021, and fall below 20 million in 2050. The country already has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and as Taiwan’s fertility rate continues to drop, by 2065, 41.2% of the population could be elderly. The challenges that come with a large elderly population, though, have already begun; the number of deaths in Taiwan averaged over 170,000 people per year in the last two years and is rising every year. Much of Taiwan is mountainous and unsuitable for development, so almost 7 million people are concentrated in Taipei proper and New Taipei City, the municipality surrounding the capital.</p><p>As the competition between the living and the dead intensifies in densely populated cities like Taipei, companies and governments are promoting alternative forms of burial, which the public largely accepts, though sometimes deeply-rooted beliefs about death mean that the public isn’t always quick to adopt them.</p><h2>Flashing Buddhas</h2><p>A space for the afterlife doesn’t come cheap in True Dragon Tower. After all, the building was designed as a “hotel for the dead,” as described by a company spokeswoman. </p><p>A basic individual niche measures about 22 by 25 centimeters (9 by 10 inches) and starts at about NT$200,000 ($6,500). More elaborate niches can cost more than NT$1 million at the top end (excluding the costs of other funereal procedures such as memorial services and burning offerings). For reference, the average monthly wage of a worker in Taiwan in 2018 was about NT$40,000. Sometimes people buy niches for themselves, but more often it’s the deceased’s family that raise the money to pay for the right spot. The fees for a niche reserve the space indefinitely, so families don’t have to worry about raising more to renew a lease of sorts.</p><p>On the outside, the tower is shaped like a white trapezoidal prism and is almost entirely opaque, with a pagoda at its apex. Each floor in the tower has a different theme depending on the customer’s religious belief and aesthetic preference. One floor offers features such as state-of-the-art LED mini Buddha statues (technology that’s been imported from Japan) embedded in each niche door. Others offer more neutral palettes, intended for Christians or atheists. Among the most striking levels is on the 17th floor, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Tadao Ando. It features a space bathed in white marble floors and stacked with porcelain niches to evoke the lightness of a heavenly afterlife. About 8% of True Dragon Tower’s niches are occupied already. </p><p>According to Chinese belief, the spirit lives on in the afterlife, so people want their loved ones to be buried somewhere pleasant. That’s why there’s a park surrounding the tower—it’s part of the hotel experience for the dead. The land—long owned by the family that runs Lung Yen—covers some 55 hectares (136 acres) and overlooks the Taiwan Strait. The park is designed to fulfill the basic feng shui principle that buildings are most auspiciously oriented (paywall) when they face water with mountains to the back. Graves and mausoleums dot the space, catering to Taiwan’s wealthiest individuals and families. There is also a columbarium for animals, reflecting the large amounts of money that Taiwanese are willing to allocate towards their pets as fewer people have children to spend it on.</p><p>Demand is only growing for Lung Yen’s facilities. In the next five to seven years, Ando will build another (more horizontal) columbarium next to True Dragon Tower, complete with gardens brimming with cherry blossom trees. The Japanese architect will also build three other such columbaria and park space around Taiwan.</p><h2>Eco-burials</h2><p>Lung Yen’s offerings are out of reach for the average Taiwanese citizen, many of whom will instead turn to public services, for which a citizen pays a minimal fee to be buried in a public facility. As columbaria become overcrowded—and NIMBYism prevents governments from freely building new facilities to store people’s ashes in dense urban areas—governments around Asia have vigorously promoted alternative forms of burial to tackle the problem of land scarcity.</p><p>Since the 2000s, the Taiwan government, along with some religious institutions, have been offering environmental “eco-burials.” Customers can opt to have a relative’s ashes scattered at sea, or buried in a mound of soil in a bed of flowers or around a tree. Wang Wen-hsiu, an official with Taipei’s mortuary services office, said that some 24,000 people die each year in the capital, and space is running out in Taipei’s three public columbaria. Currently, all ashes must be exhumed from their niches after 50 years unless somebody renews the lease. If no one does, then the government exhumes the ashes and eco-buries them. </p><p>Chinese traditions of ancestral worship and the firm belief that the dead should have an eternal place to rest make the scattering of ashes a hard proposition for most Taiwanese to accept. But it is catching on. In Taipei, about 22% of people chose eco-burials, particularly tree burials, in the first half of 2018 (sea burials are the least popular form of eco-burial in Taiwan). Non-traditional burials have had less success elsewhere, like in Hong Kong where, despite the government’s attempt (paywall) to popularize them, only 13% opted for eco-burials in 2017.</p><h2>Going mainstream</h2><p>There are a few reasons why eco-burials have been so successful in Taiwan. For one, they’re free. The Taipei government will even subsidize people who want to take their relatives’ ashes out of a public columbarium for a green burial, said Wang.</p><p>Another reason is demographics. Wang Chen-ling (no relation to the other Wang), an associate professor in land management at Feng Chia University in Taichung, said as Taiwan’s population ages and its birth rate plummets, people who don’t have dependents are more prone to choosing a hassle-free form of burial that doesn’t require relatives to tend to a grave or perform rites of ancestral worship. Religious groups also had a major effect on bringing the concept into the mainstream in Taiwan, said Wang, particularly after a revered Buddhist master, when he died in 2009, chose for his ashes to be scattered in a garden at the monastery he founded on the outskirts of Taipei. Today, there is even a waiting list (link in Chinese) for tree burials at the monastery.</p><p>But a more fundamental change in the way that Taiwanese think about death is underway. Wang, the city mortuary official, said that successful attempts to “park-ify” eco-burial grounds are also helping to make death less scary and taboo, and more a part of everyday life,and promote green burials in the process.</p><p>Taipei now has two public parks (link in Chinese) that double as graveyards where tree and flower burials take place. People are increasingly hanging out there—the government has even organized music concerts at tree-burial grounds—as a communal way of remembering the dead in place of performing traditional rites at graves or columbaria. In the future, going to one of these parks could be like “going to an art museum,” Wang said.</p><p>Lily Kong, a geographer, wrote in an academic journal (paywall) in 2011 that Taipei was one city that had successfully managed to change the perception of cemeteries in Chinese cultures of being “sites wrapped in unhealthy miasma.” </p><p>As people in land-strapped nations move away from cultural practices that take up too much space, they may find those places become more pleasant to live. Instead of seeking out solemn spaces dedicated to the dead, their descendants may attend a concert or take a walk in the park as a way to remember their ancestors.</p><p>Be sure to download the Quartz Brief app for iOS to explore our 3D model of Dragon Tower in augmented reality.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/quartz/1555250298284','[\"220\", \"155\", \"79\"]',1,'在土地稀缺的台北，真龍塔是死者的垂直家園','null','台灣逢甲大學土地管理副教授王晨玲（與其他王無關）表示，隨著台灣人口老齡化和出生率驟降，沒有家屬的人更容易選擇無恥的埋葬形式，不需要親戚傾向於墳墓或進行祖先崇拜的儀式。','<p>坐落在台灣北部海岸線附近的山區，就在它的首都之外，是一座塔，一旦滿了，將容納40萬人的灰燼。 </p><p>真龍塔高20層，是世界上最大的骨灰龕。這是困擾亞洲各國的兩個問題的顯著表現 - 人口迅速老齡化，城市中心的死者缺乏空間。 </p><p>這使得死亡在像台灣這樣的島國大做生意，這個島國略大於馬里蘭州。 True Dragon Tower由台灣上市公司Lung Yen Life Service擁有，該公司是按市值計算的全球第三大殯儀服務運營商。經過十年的建設，該塔於2002年終於開業。它的高度飆升部分是對台灣火葬率迅速提高的回應。龍雁發言人表示，在二十世紀五十年代（pdf，中文鏈接），台灣政府推動它而不是地面埋葬，預計未來會出現空間緊張。台灣90％以上的人現在火化，這一比例與亞洲其他發達地區如日本和香港相似。 </p><p>根據世界衛生組織對老齡化社會的定義，65歲以上人口目前佔台灣2360萬人口的14％以上。根據政府的預測，台灣的人口將在2021年達到峰值，並在2050年降至2000萬以下。該國已經是世界上出生率最低的國家之一，隨著台灣的生育率繼續下降，到2065年，41.2％的人口人口可能是老年人。然而，老年人口眾多的挑戰已經開始;在過去的兩年裡，台灣的死亡人數平均每年超過17萬人，並且每年都在增加。台灣大部分地區多山，不適合發展，因此近700萬人集中在台北本土和首都周邊的新北市。 </p><p>隨著生活與死亡之間的競爭在台北這樣人口稠密的城市中愈演愈烈，公司和政府正在推廣公眾在很大程度上接受的其他形式的埋葬，儘管有時根深蒂固的死亡信念意味著公眾並不總是很快採用它們。 </p><h2>閃爍的佛像</h2><p>在True Dragon Tower，來世的空間並不便宜。畢竟，該建築被設計為“死者的酒店”，正如公司女發言人所描述的那樣。 </p><p>一個基本的個人利基措施大約22乘25厘米（9乘10英寸），起價約為200,000新台幣（6,500美元）。更精細的利基在高端可能花費超過100萬新台幣（不包括其他虛假程序的費用，如追悼會和焚燒產品）。作為參考，2018年台灣一名工人的平均月工資約為40,000新台幣。有時人們為自己購買壁龕，但更常見的是，死者的家人會籌集資金來支付正確的費用。利基的費用無限期地保留了空間，因此家庭不必擔心增加更多的租約。 </p><p>在外面，塔的形狀像一個白色的梯形棱柱，幾乎完全不透明，頂部有一座寶塔。塔樓的每個樓層都有不同的主題，具體取決於客戶的宗教信仰和審美偏好。一層提供嵌入每個壁龕門的最先進的LED迷你佛像（從日本進口的技術）等功能。其他人提供更多中性調色板，供基督徒或無神論者使用。其中最引人注目的是17樓，由普利茲克獎得主日本建築師安藤忠雄設計。它擁有一個沐浴在白色大理石地板上的空間，並與瓷器壁龕疊放，以喚起天堂般的來世的輕盈。大約8％的真龍塔的壁龕已經被佔用。 </p><p>根據中國人的信仰，精神依然存在於來世，所以人們希望他們的親人被安葬在一個愉快的地方。這就是為什麼塔周圍有一個公園 - 它是死者酒店體驗的一部分。這個由龍仁家族擁有的土地佔地面積約55公頃（136英畝），俯瞰台灣海峽。該公園的設計旨在實現建築物最為吉祥的基本風水原則（付費牆），當他們面向山脈後面的水。墳墓和陵墓點綴著這個空間，迎合了台灣最富有的個人和家庭。還有一個動物骨灰龕，反映了台灣人願意為寵物分配的大量資金，因為有更少的人有孩子可以花錢。 </p><p>龍雁的設施需求只會增長。在接下來的五到七年裡，安藤將在真龍塔旁邊建造另一個（更水平的）骨灰龕，並配有盛滿櫻花樹的花園。這位日本建築師還將在台灣周圍建造另外三個這樣的骨灰龕和公園空間。 </p><h2>生態墓葬</h2><p>對於一般台灣公民而言，龍顏的產品是遙不可及的，其中許多人將轉向公共服務，公民支付最低費用將被埋在公共設施中。由於骨灰龕變得人滿為患 - 而NIMBYism阻止政府自由建設新的設施，以便在人口稠密的城市地區儲存人們的骨灰 - 亞洲各國政府大力推廣其他形式的葬禮來解決土地稀缺問題。 </p><p>自2000年代以來，台灣政府和一些宗教機構一直在提供環保的“生態埋葬”。顧客可以選擇在海上散落一個親戚的骨灰，或者埋在花壇或周圍的土堆中一顆樹。台北太平間服務辦公室的官員王文秀表示，首都每年約有24,000人死亡，台北三大公共場所的空間不足。目前，除非有人續簽租約，否則所有的灰燼必須在50年後從他們的壁龕中挖掘出來。如果沒有人這樣做，那麼政府就會挖出灰燼並將生態掩埋起來。 </p><p>中國傳統的祖先崇拜和堅信死者應該有一個永恆的休息場所，這使得灰燼分散成為大多數台灣人接受的堅定主張。但它正在流行起來。在台北，大約22％的人在2018年上半年選擇了生態埋葬，特別是樹葬（海葬是台灣最不受歡迎的生態埋葬形式）。非傳統的葬禮在其他地方取得的成功較少，例如在香港，儘管政府試圖（付費牆）推廣這些葬禮，但只有13％的人在2017年選擇了生態葬禮。 </p><h2>走向主流</h2><p>生態埋葬在台灣取得如此成功的原因有幾個。首先，他們是自由的。王說，台北政府甚至會資助那些想把親戚的骨灰帶出公共骨灰龕進行綠色葬禮的人。 </p><p>另一個原因是人口統計學。台灣逢甲大學土地管理副教授王晨玲（與其他王無關）表示，隨著台灣人口老齡化和出生率驟降，沒有家屬的人更容易選擇無恥的埋葬形式，不需要親戚傾向於墳墓或進行祖先崇拜的儀式。王說，特別是在一位受人尊敬的佛教大師於2009年去世後，宗教團體對將這一概念納入主流也產生了重大影響。他選擇將骨灰散落在他建立於修道院的修道院的花園中。台北市郊。今天，甚至還有一個等待名單（中文鏈接），用於修道院的樹葬。 </p><p>但台灣人對待死亡的方式正在發生根本性的變化。城市太平間官員王先生表示，成功嘗試“停放”生態墓地也有助於使死亡變得不那麼可怕和禁忌，更多地成為日常生活的一部分，並在此過程中促進綠色葬禮。 </p><p>台北現在有兩個公園（中文鏈接），可以作為墓地進行樹木和花葬。人們越來越多地在那裡閒逛 - 政府甚至在樹木墓地舉辦音樂會 - 作為一種記憶死者的共同方式，而不是在墳墓或骨灰龕中進行傳統儀式。在未來，前往其中一個公園可能就像“去藝術博物館”，王說。 </p><p>地理學家Lily Kong在2011年的學術期刊（付費專欄）中寫道，台北是一個成功地改變了中國文化中的墓地觀念的城市，即“不健康的m氣”。 </p><p>由於土地緊張的國家的人們遠離那些佔據太多空間的文化習俗，他們可能會發現這些地方的生活更加愉快。他們的後代可以參加音樂會或在公園散步，以此來紀念他們的祖先，而不是尋找專門為死者服務的莊嚴空間。 </p><p>請務必下載適用於iOS的Quartz Brief應用程序，以探索我們在增強現實中的龍塔3D模型。 </p>'),(171,8,'https://qz.com/india/1569959/tier-2-indias-splurging-on-luxury-boutiques-fashion-jewellery/','Small-town India is splurging on luxury—and here’s what it’s buying','null','This spike in the growth in luxury spending in tier II cities came amidst “some strict measures by the Indian government in 2016 such as demonetisation, increased excise duty on gold and diamond jewellery, and increased tax on other luxury goods to curb ‘black money,’” the American Express report reads.','Aria Thaker','2019-03-11T06:56:27.000Z',1552287387000,'<p>India’s luxury market is getting a boost from the country’s tier II cities.</p><p>High end spending in these towns grew at a rate 30 times greater than in tier I cities between 2013 and 2018, according to an analysis by credit card company American Express.

It was the first time one of her friends had passed away, and she wasn’t sure how to feel. Wang had written a letter to Santa the year before, so she decided to sit down and write another. This time, she shared her feelings.</p><p>“I’m not going to devote this whole card to talking about Christmas and presents,” she wrote in English in an undated letter sent to St. Nick in Rovaniemi, Finland, which bills itself as the “official hometown of Santa Claus.” The town’s post office, which shared the letter, asked Quartz to not publish the full name of the writer to protect her privacy.</p><p>“Yesterday, I found out a girl in my dance class died. How did the girl feel when she learned she had cancer? I hope the girl is happy now. Sometimes, life doesn’t go the way you wish. But you have to stand up and control your own life. Because you’re the only one who has the ability to change it.”</p><p>Wang is among a fast-growing number of people from China who are writing to Santa. The Santa Claus Village’s main post office in the Arctic Circle receives some 500,000 letters annually from across the world, the majority of which are from Greater China, the office says, a region that also includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p><p>Last Christmas, Santa received a record 16,500 letters from mainland China, making up 15% of the approximately 110,000 letters from the region. In 2014, Greater China overtook the United Kingdom, Italy, and Poland for sending the most letters. Santa’s rising popularity, however, is a stark contrast to China’s ongoing war on Christmas.</p><h2>Banned Christmas</h2><p>Chinese enthusiasm for Christmas isn’t necessarily surprising considering the holiday’s commercial appeal, growing Chinese exposure to the West through media and study abroad, and recent efforts by Finland to attract Chinese visitors to Rovaniemi. But the phenomenon also coincides with an intensifying government crackdown on Christianity and Western influences more broadly from NGOs to international-style education.</p><p>Unlike in Hong Kong, Christmas is not an official holiday in mainland China, and has in fact increasingly been banned in various cities in recent years. On Dec. 15, security officials in Langfang, a city in Hebei province, issued a notice prohibiting the display of Christmas materials and spreading of “religious propaganda” in public areas including schools and plazas, according to ChinaAid, a US-based group that advocates for religious freedom. The notice also warned against selling Christmas products and instructed local workers to ensure a “healthy and orderly environment” during the Christmas period.</p><p>Last Christmas, some local governments, Communist Party organizations, and schools also restricted celebrations. One city even said it would fine individuals caught selling or making fake snow, the Financial Times reported (paywall). State-backed Chinese media last year denied a national Christmas crackdown and insisted local bans were for maintaining security. Critics, however, believe that the grounds of maintaining security are little more than a front to restrict what little religious freedoms remain in China.</p><p>This month, China’s Christian churches are witnessing an intensifying attack on their freedom to worship, starting with the detention of more than 100 worshippers attending an unofficial congregation held by the Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu, one of the few house churches that operates in the open. While many were subsequently released and placed under surveillance, the church’s prominent pastor and his wife remain in custody, having been arrested on allegations of “inciting subversion of state power.”</p><p>Chu Yanqing, an underground “family church” leader in Beijing, told Quartz that the crackdown on unofficial congregations has intensified since 2016, and that Christmas continues to be a difficult time. A former member of Shouwang Church, the largest unofficial Protestant congregation in the capital before it was shut in 2011, he recalls holding public Christmas celebrations with over 300 people a decade ago. Such an event would be impossible now, he said, adding that even festivities in official churches are subject to scrutiny.</p><p>“Every Christmas, police will monitor churches. I’ve never heard of anything dangerous happening, but they do it because they’re worried,” he said. Instead of celebrating on Christmas Eve or Christmas day this year, he plans to hold a gathering of fewer than 30 people after the holiday has passed.</p><h2>Christmas without Christ</h2><p>Despite China’s political wariness of Christmas, its commercial potential is unmissable. Secular decorations are ubiquitous in shopping malls, and the holiday is now promoted as a sort of hump-day shopping period between the retail bonanza of Singles’ Day on Nov. 11 and the Lunar New Year. China’s manufacturing sector has also built a $5.6 billion industry around the holiday, churning out fairy lights and other festive goods, Bloomberg reported (paywall). Production in the manufacturing hub of Yiwu alone accounts for 60% of the world’s Christmas decorations.</p><p>Overseas travel has also fueled China’s Christmas frenzy. In 2016, Finnish organizations partnered with Alibaba to launch a campaign promoting tourism to Finland, with the Santa village in Rovaniemi as one of its main attractions. The city was also designated as a “friendship town” of Harbin, the wintry capital of Heilongjiang province. In 2010, Xi, then vice president of China, went to Rovaniemi and posed for photos with Santa during an official visit.</p><p>Statistics from Visit Rovaniemi, which promotes the city as a tourist destination, show that registered overnight stays from Chinese visitors have rapidly increased in the past decade, from 3,300 visits in 2010 to 32,349 last year. Sanna Kärkkäinen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi, said the city set up an account (link in Chinese) for Santa on Chinese social network Weibo, and incorporated the Alipay payment system in 2016 to cater to Chinese tourists.</p><p>In the town’s main post office, letters from China in all shapes and sizes are stacked in a cabinet in the corner. Some are scrawled on colorful stationery and peppered with drawings of classic Christmas icons. Others are carefully written on rice paper in traditional Chinese calligraphy. Many are bilingual.</p><p>Most Chinese children may not be fully aware of Christmas’s religious background nor of China’s complicated relationship to the holiday. Still, the universal values of Christmas—generosity, hope, and gratitude—are what’s driving them to write to St. Nick.</p><p>Growing up in Beijing, Zhang first learned about Santa from elementary school teachers, who stressed he was nothing more than a fictional character of Western culture.

More broadly, though, the result is the latest example of how referendums can be deeply undemocratic.</p><p>The high court decision did not legalize same-sex marriage; it only declared that the legislature would have to make marriage equality law within two years. That meant it was up to Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which gained power in 2016, to follow through. It failed to do so.</p><p>That ineptitude provided an opportunity for groups in Taiwan opposed to marriage equality, led by conservative Christians. These groups took advantage of new rules, passed in 2017, that made it easier to hold and pass referendums. Previously in Taiwan, a referendum required signatures from 5% of the electorate in order to be placed on the ballot. That was reduced to 1.5%. And for a ballot measure to pass, it now only needs “yes” votes from 25% of the population, compared to the earlier 50%.</p><p>That is a low bar. Even though Christians make up just 5% of Taiwan’s population, they were able to collect the paltry 280,000 signatures needed to make their referendum happen. Their proposal to define marriage as “between a man and a woman” received over 7 million “yes” votes—more than a counter-referendum endorsing same-sex marriage, but far less than half of Taiwan’s over 18 million registered voters.</p><p>This liberal approach to referendums has backfired on the DPP—a left-leaning party that broadly supports LGBT rights—which originally pushed to relax the rules. When the new rules were announced, the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, called it a “historic moment” in which “people are the masters.”</p><p>But as the DPP has found out, that is far from the reality of referendums.</p><p>One problem with referendums is that they reduce highly complicated matters to a simple yes or no. The most consequential example of our time is, of course, Brexit. Because the European Union is a large, supranational entity, many British voters felt they had lost the ability to exert their political will. But to distill the nation’s entire relationship to its most important ally to a binary choice was short-sighted, and has led to the nightmare of defining what exactly Brexit is, saddening and angering just about everyone along the way.</p><p>The decision on marriage law in Taiwan reveals an even bigger problem with referendums, though: they turn politics into a popularity contest. Democracy is not just about voting, but also pluralism and the protection of minority rights. In deciding to call marriage discrimination unconstitutional, the court was acting to protect those rights for the LGBT community. Plus, given Taiwan’s law that a referendum needs only 25% of voters to say “yes,” it doesn’t even meet the standard of majority rule.</p><p>In 2017, the high court put Taiwan on the world stage as a model for other Asian nations on human rights issues. That reputation looks fragile now. Over the weekend, Tsai stepped down as party leader after the DPP suffered wider losses across the country. There is lots of blame to go around—blame Tsai and the DPP for not putting same-sex marriage into law, blame conservative groups who cannot tolerate ways of life other than their own.

Since she came to power, Beijing has pursued increasingly hardline policies against the self-ruled territory, including limiting its nationals from visiting Taiwan and pressuring Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies to switch their allegiance to Beijing.</p><p>After the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the defeated Nationalist, or KMT, forces fled to Taiwan and established a competing Chinese government there, while the Communist Party ruled from Beijing. Since then, Taiwan has governed itself and holds democratic elections, while Beijing has never relinquished its claims over the island. Gou was born in Taiwan, after his parents came over from China after the civil war.</p><p>Gou was among the first wave of Taiwanese companies that shifted production to China in the late 1980s as it embarked on economic reforms, and built up a massive electronics-manufacturing empire there. Foxconn, or Hon Hai as it’s officially known, has also drawn scrutiny in recent years after the company’s poor treatment of workers was cited as a cause of a spate of suicides at its factories in China.</p><p>Gou’s decision to run for president in January’s elections, along with the meteoric rise of the KMT’s Han Kuo-yu, the populist, pro-China mayor of Taiwan’s second city Kaohsiung, should have the ruling party deeply worried. The DPP recently suffered heavy losses across the country in local elections in November that gave China reason to celebrate as Beijing would rather have the KMT, which stresses close economic ties with China and eschews independence talk, in power.

Beijing’s malign influence is apparent everywhere, while the United States is seen as largely absent. Washington must wake up to the danger of China’s massive effort to infiltrate, undermine and eventually abolish Taiwan’s democracy.</p><p>Tsai called for Washington’s help to confront Beijing’s comprehensive campaign to exert control over Taiwanese politics and society, which is steadily eroding a 40-year status quo that has kept a shaky peace. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which governs the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, stipulates that the United States will “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.”</p><p>In 2019, those words ring hollow. Xi Jinping’s government brazenly uses economic and political pressure to interfere in Taiwan — an attempt to turn the Taiwanese people and their leaders toward Beijing and against the West. Xi himself smashed the status quo in January when he publicly called for Taiwan to rejoin China under the “One Country, Two Systems” model. One look at Hong Kong should be enough for any Taiwanese citizen to realize that means a steady erosion of their freedoms and sovereignty.</p><p>During interviews with Taiwanese politicians, officials and national security experts, our delegation in Taiwan, organized by the East West Center, heard grave warnings. Following its successful interference effort in last November’s local elections, Beijing is now focused intensely on ousting Tsai and her Democratic People’s Party in next January’s presidential contest.</p><p>“Next year’s election might be the last meaningful election in Taiwan. After that, it will be a Hong Kong-style election,” said Chen Ming-Chi, deputy minister of the Mainland Affairs Council. If China succeeds in returning the Beijing-sympathetic Nationalist Party (KMT) to power, that could be the tipping point after which Taiwan can never again exert its own sovereignty, he said. “2020 would be the beginning of the reunification.”</p><p>In other words, a Chinese military invasion is no longer the scenario Taiwanese fear most. China’s strategy to take over Taiwan is focused now on the hybrid warfare tactics authoritarian regimes increasingly deploy in free societies. Pro-Beijing interests have bought up a huge portion of Taiwanese media and coordinate with Beijing to spread propaganda and fake news and manipulate social media.</p><p>The Chinese government uses economic coercion to both recruit and punish Taiwanese leaders. Meanwhile, China is working overtime to strip Taiwan of its diplomatic allies and keep it out of multilateral institutions. Beijing is literally trying to erase the country from the map.</p><p>Taiwan is the testing ground for these methods, but China is now exporting them to other places, including the United States. That’s a threat not just to Taiwan but also to democracies worldwide, said Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien.</p><p>“Taiwan is only the beginning,” he said. “They want their new civilization to become a new global order. That’s what they are thinking. And together with an expansion of their physical power, now they are putting their dreams into reality.”</p><p>Several KMT officials and former officials told our delegation fears of China were overblown and seeking accommodation with Beijing was the only reasonable approach. Former deputy foreign minister Bruce Linghu said the KMT is not “pro-China” but rather “pro-peace.”</p><p>“Taiwan has to play it smart,” he said. “Why should we be provocative with China?”</p><p>KMT officials insist they support the U.S.-China relationship and are not trying to appease Beijing. But actions speak louder than words. While Tsai was speaking to Americans, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, a rising KMT leader and presidential prospect, was holding controversial meetings with Chinese Communist Party officials in Hong Kong and Macau. It’s clear which relationship the KMT prioritizes.</p><p>The U.S. interest in helping the current Taiwanese government defend its democracy from Chinese interference and aggression is understood — but our will is under question. The Trump administration, despite being full of pro-Taiwan officials, has been inconsistent. There’s progress on arms sales but no progress on what Tsai wants most, a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement.

Well, sort of. It has a constitution, an army and an elected government, and yet the United Nations doesn’t recognize it. The reason? Taiwan became the home base of Chinese who fled Communism in the 1940s, and China considers the island one of its provinces, the government as illegitimate and any talk of independence as deeply hostile. China blasted missiles into the waters surrounding Taiwan in the mid-1990s as a warning not to go it alone. Relations and trade links have strengthened since then, but Taiwan’s first female president, leader of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, has come to power at a time when China is growing more assertive.</p><p>The Situation</p><p>Elected in a landslide in 2016, President Tsai Ing-wen pledged peaceful ties with China even as she resisted pressure from the mainland to support the “one-China principle” — the understanding that both sides belong to one China, even if they have different ideas about what that means. The Beijing government considers itself the rightful ruler of Taiwan, even though the island has been governed separately since 1949. In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested that groups and individuals in mainland China and Taiwan who support the “one China” framework enter into “in-depth democratic consultations” and work toward unification  — the clearest sign yet that he wants the 70-year dispute settled during his tenure. His comments came a day after Tsai warned against continued threats from China. Taiwan under Tsai — whose party supports achieving full independence — has pursued closer ties with the U.S., including the resumption of high-level U.S. official visits to Taiwan, which President Donald Trump signed into law.  In March, the Trump administration indicated it may sell fighter jets to Taiwan, a move that would incense China. Xi has warned that efforts to widen divisions with Taiwan would be “punished by history” and that his country had the capabilities to stop any attempt at independence. China has picked off Taiwan’s few remaining allies, launched regular “encirclement patrols” with military jets around Taiwan’s airspace and pressured international airlines into listing Taiwan as part of China. Tsai’s party suffered heavy losses in local elections to the China-friendly opposition in November, raising questions about her prospects in the general election in January 2020. </p><p>The Background</p><p>Victory by the Communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949 forced the nationalist Kuomintang government to flee the mainland and cross the 110-mile Taiwan Strait along with more than 1.5 million refugees. Staunch U.S. support mellowed in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon shifted America’s diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in an effort to contain the Soviet Union. Even so, America passed a 1979 law committing to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait and facilitate arms sales to the island democracy. After 38 years of often brutal rule, Taiwan dropped martial law in 1987 and a year later got its first native-born president, who went on to become its first democratically elected leader in 1996. Tensions erupted into Chinese military action twice — in the 1950s then again around a Taiwan election in the mid-1990s. China passed a law in 2005 authorizing an attack if the island declares independence. Even with only a handful of nations recognizing Taiwan, its 23.6 million people have built their economy into a technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Average income is three times greater than that of China. Much of Apple’s iPhone is made by Taiwanese companies, while tech giants including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company lead the world in making computer chips for other firms.</p><p>The Argument</p><p>China aims more than 1,200 missiles at Taiwan and no peace treaty has been signed in the seven decades since the governments split. While many China-watchers say there is too much at stake for military confrontation, especially given the prospect of U.S. involvement and possible economic fallout, Trump’s election has added a degree of uncertainty to old assumptions. China’s actions in Asia’s disputed waters have indicated a more expansionist and aggressive regional stance. Taiwan’s voters, wary of the lack of political freedom in China, turned to Tsai to keep the peace while building international ties — something of a challenge given its neighbor’s influence — with a view to a future less dependent on the mainland. </p><p>To contact the authors of this QuickTake: Debra Mao in Hong Kong at dmao5@bloomberg.netSamson Ellis in Taipei at sellis29@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this QuickTake: Grant Clark at gclark@bloomberg.net</p><p>First published Jan. 10, 2016</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fzXgSDVAyp2Awu6hd2cYmkrEXZs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCUTO6CMLII6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg','[\"252\", \"233\", \"251\"]',3,'台灣的走鋼絲','null','1月，中國國家主席習近平建議支持“一個中國”框架的中國大陸和台灣的團體和個人進行“深入的民主協商”並努力實現統一 - 這是他希望70年的最明顯跡象他在任職期間解決了爭執。','<p>台灣是一個國家，對嗎？好吧，有點。它有憲法，軍隊和民選政府，但聯合國卻不承認它。原因？台灣成為20世紀40年代逃離共產主義的中國人的家園，中國認為台灣是其中的一個省，政府是非法的，任何獨立的言論都是極端敵對的。中國在20世紀90年代中期向台灣周圍的水域發射導彈，警告不要單打獨鬥。自那時以來，兩國關係和貿易聯繫得到了加強，但台灣第一位女性總統，獨立傾向民主進步黨的領導人，在中國越來越自信的時候上台執政。 </p><p>情況</p><p>蔡英文總統在2016年以壓倒性優勢當選，承諾與中國保持和平關係，即使她抵制來自大陸的壓力，支持“一個中國原則” - 即使他們有不同，雙方都屬於同一個中國的理解關於這意味著什麼的想法。北京政府認為自己是台灣的合法統治者，儘管該島自1949年以來一直獨立統治。1月，中國國家主席習近平建議支持“一個中國”框架的中國大陸和台灣的團體和個人進入“深入的民主協商“並努力實現統一 - 這是他希望在他任職期間解決70年爭端的最明顯跡象。在Tsai警告中國繼續威脅之後一天，他發表了上述言論。台灣統治下的台灣 - 其黨支持實現完全獨立 - 與美國建立了更密切的聯繫，包括恢復美國對台灣的高級官方訪問，唐納德特朗普總統簽署了該法案。今年3月，特朗普政府表示可能向台灣出售戰鬥機，這一舉動將惹惱中國。習近平警告稱，擴大與台灣分歧的努力將“受到歷史的懲罰”，並且他的國家有能力製止任何獨立的企圖。中國已經挑選台灣少數幾個盟友，在台灣領空周圍定期進行“圍剿巡邏”，迫使國際航空公司將台灣列為中國的一部分。蔡的黨在11月的中國反對派地方選舉中遭受重創，引發了對她在2020年1月大選中前景的質疑。 </p><p>的背景</p><p>共產黨在1949年中國內戰中的勝利迫使民族主義國民黨政府逃離大陸，跨越110英里的台灣海峽以及150多萬難民。 20世紀70年代，當美國總統理查德尼克松將美國對台灣的外交承認轉移到台灣以遏制蘇聯時，堅定的美國支持得到了鞏固。即便如此，美國還是通過了1979年的法律，致力於維護台灣海峽的和平，並促進對台灣民主的軍售。經過38年經常殘酷的統治，台灣於1987年放棄戒嚴，一年後獲得了第一位土生土長的總統，後來成為1996年第一位民主選舉產生的領導人。緊張局勢爆發於中國兩次軍事行動 - 在20世紀50年代然後在20世紀90年代中期的台灣選舉中再次出現。 2005年，中國通過了一項法律，授權該島宣布獨立。即使只有少數幾個國家承認台灣，其2360萬人已將其經濟建設成為一個技術和製造業強國。平均收入是中國的三倍。蘋果的大部分iPhone都是由台灣公司製造的，而包括台灣半導體製造公司在內的科技巨頭在為其他公司製造計算機芯片方面處於世界領先地位。 </p><p>爭論</p><p>中國的目標是台灣1200多枚導彈，自政府分裂以來的七十年裡，沒有簽署任何和平條約。雖然許多中國觀察人士表示，軍事對抗存在太大的危險，特別是考慮到美國的參與和可能的經濟影響，特朗普的選舉給舊的假設增加了一定程度的不確定性。中國在亞洲爭議水域的行動表明了更具擴張性和侵略性的區域立場。台灣選民對中國缺乏政治自由持謹慎態度，轉向蔡在保持和平的同時建立國際關係 - 鑑於其鄰國的影響力，這是一個挑戰 - 以期未來對大陸的依賴程度降低。 </p><p>如需了解此QuickTake的作者：Debra Mao在香港dmao5@bloomberg.netSamson Ellis在台北，電子郵件：sellis29@bloomberg.net </p><p>要聯繫負責此QuickTake的編輯：Grant Clark，電子郵件地址為gclark@bloomberg.net </p><p>首次發佈於2016年1月10日</p><p> ©2019 Bloomberg LP </p>'),(202,9,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/rough-straits-in-the-china-taiwan-relationship/2019/03/06/95abcd04-3e78-11e9-85ad-779ef05fd9d8_story.html','Rough straits in the China-Taiwan relationship','null','Tsai takes a confrontational approach by not recognizing the 1992 consensus between Taipei and Beijing, namely “one China, respective interpretations,” making cross-strait relations rather difficult to manage and harming Taiwan’s economy and diplomatic relations.','Letters to the Editor','1551911613000',1551911613000,'<p>Regarding the Feb. 26 news article “Taiwan’s 2020 election campaign is all about Washington vs. Beijing”:</p><p>The article said Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen may have signaled that Taiwan is “a bulwark against Chinese expansionism” in East Asia.

And eventually they diagnosed stomach flu, gave him two prescriptions and discharged him.</p><p>“Each day since I’ve gotten progressively better and am now pretty much back to normal,” Bozeat wrote. “The bill for the ER visit? . . . US $80.00.”</p><p>He sarcastically titled his tale “The Horrors of Socialized Medicine,” noting he didn’t even have health insurance — in Taiwan or the United States. If he had Taiwan’s national health insurance, his costs would have been a fraction of $80, he wrote.</p><p>The post struck a nerve, as debates about health care and whether to move toward “Medicare-for-all” loom over the 2020 presidential race. More than 200,000 people shared it.</p><p>[A family couldn’t pay their bills, so the city took their dog and sold it on eBay]</p><p>Taiwan has a single-payer system — meaning the government controls health-care payments, though most of the service providers and hospitals are privatized. Liberal groups and officials are increasingly looking to single-payer systems to address both the United States’ high health-care expenses, and the millions of people who are uninsured.</p><p>About 17 percent of the United States gross domestic product in 2017 went to health care — nearly twice the average 8.8 percent for other developed countries, according to data cited by Health Affairs. And that number is projected to increase as health-care spending rises to nearly 20 percent of the GDP by 2020, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p><p>Bozeat estimated his treatment in the United States, without insurance, would have likely cost thousands of dollars.</p><p>“But here in Taiwan I was able to receive speedy, quality care comparable to what I would have gotten in a US hospital for relatively small amount of money,” he said.</p><p>[The real reason the U.S. spends twice as much on health care as other wealthy countries]</p><p>According to a Health Affairs report by Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy research analyst at Princeton, Taiwan instituted a single-payer health-care system in 1995. (Cheng’s late husband, Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton economist and health-care expert, had been the one to recommend a single-payer system to the country in the 1980s.)</p><p>The country is home to about 24 million people and is the world’s 19th-largest economy; 99.9 percent of its residents are enrolled in the national health-care program, regardless of preexisting conditions.</p><p>“Comprehensive benefits include inpatient and outpatient care, mental health care, prescription drugs, dental care, Chinese medicine, dialysis, and day care for the elderly,” Cheng notes.</p><p>She continues:</p><p>About 6.1 percent of the GDP in Taiwan is spent on health care; in the United States, one of the highest levels of a developed country, it’s about 17 percent.</p><p>In an interview, Cheng gave examples of price disparities between the United States and Taiwan, based on statistics from insurance companies and government agencies.</p><p>Harvoni, a drug to treat hepatitis C, costs $2,132 for a course of treatment in Taiwan; in the United States, the same amount costs an average of $32,114, she said.</p><p>An MRI costs $288 in Taiwan; in the United States, it’s $1,119.</p><p>A C-section costs $1,404 in Taiwan; in the United States, it’s $15,106.</p><p>Interest in Taiwan’s health-care system has been surging in recent years. Chen said she briefed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on the system and will speak to state lawmakers in California on Friday amid a broader push for universal health care in the state.</p><p>“People envy [Taiwan’s] system because they’re spending a third of [what] we’re spending,” she said. “It’s very high-performing in terms of cost coverage and benefits. Many, many countries that are looking to cover everyone — they are looking to Taiwan’s model as a guide.”</p><p>Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative think tank American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said inflated U.S. health-care costs were in part the result of a “pattern of overutilization of some things like excessive testing and underutilization of preventive care.”</p><p>\"You add it all up, it costs a lot,” he said.</p><p>Holtz-Eakin said a recent study of prices looked at 23 drugs and found they cost 80 percent more in the United States than other places. Still, 11 of those drugs were available in every other country in the study, Holtz-Eakin said.</p><p>“So one of the prices you pay in another country is you don’t get access to some diagnoses and therapies,” he said. “It’s hard to put a price tag on that.”</p><p>[An 11-year-old pleaded for an abortion after she was raped. She was forced to give birth.]</p><p>While a few countries with socialized medicine systems, like Canada and Britain, are known for long wait times for some procedures, Taiwan does not experience this problem, Cheng wrote. She highlighted another significant disparity between the Taiwanese and American health-care systems: administrative costs were much lower in Taiwan than in the United States. (“A staff of fewer than 3,000 administer the NHI for Taiwan’s population of 23.8 million,” she noted.)</p><p>Bozeat said in a brief direct message exchange that he thought his post had gone viral because it was likely “shocking to most Americans who saw it, particularly the price.”</p><p>“I received a ton of direct messages and comments from people sharing their higher bills, WITH insurance,” he wrote. “Some people also attacked me and called me a liar. Even though they know nothing about Taiwan or its health care system. Interestingly I received a lot of support from Taiwanese people who thanked me for praising their health care system.”</p><p>He had followed up the viral post with another with a plea for universal health care.</p><p>“Taiwan is less wealthy than the US, yet it spends less and gets more out of its healthcare system. We see the same story repeat itself,” he wrote. “This debate is all so tiresome, because there is no debate. Universal healthcare works, it can be done here, it can be done in any country with sufficient resources. All we need is political will and an implementation plan.”</p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DJbGYkTLFecp8apsvAAkCFKmQ_c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UYTIETAD5EI6TFMMBJQBEJX7NM.jpg','[\"96\", \"85\", \"6\"]',1,'一個美國人在台灣生病了。他回憶起了“社交醫學恐怖”的故事。','null','他決定是時候到醫院接受治療了，不知道從未去過台灣的醫院 - 一個擁有國家醫療保健系統的國家，或者Bozeat所寫的，“社交醫學。','<p> Facebook的帖子用IV的圖像說明。 “去了台灣的急診室，”它開始了。 </p><p> 25歲的學生凱文·博澤特（Kevin Bozeat）寫道，在台灣學習期間患有嚴重的胃腸道症狀：胃痙攣，不會減輕的嘔吐，以及最糟糕的是，無法保持任何體液流失。 </p><p>凌晨3點左右，他決定是時候去醫院接受治療了，不知道從未去過台灣的一家醫院會有什麼期望 - 一個擁有國家醫療保健系統的國家，或者Bozeat所寫的，“社交醫學“。 </p><p>他在抵達後的20分鐘內接受了檢查並給了靜脈注射液。抽血者抽血，實驗室對其進行了測試。醫院技術人員進行了超聲波檢查以確保他沒有膽結石或闌尾炎。最終他們診斷出了胃病，給了他兩個處方並將他解雇了。 </p><p> “自從我逐漸變得更好並且現在幾乎恢復正常以後，每一天，”Bozeat寫道。 “ER訪問的法案？ 。 。 。 80.00美元。“ </p><p>他諷刺地稱他的故事為“社會化醫學的恐怖”，並指出他甚至沒有健康保險 - 在台灣或美國。他寫道，如果他有台灣的國民健康保險，他的費用將只是80美元的一小部分。 </p><p>這篇文章引起了人們的不滿，因為關於醫療保健的爭論以及是否會在2020年總統大選中走向“人人享有醫療保險”。超過20萬人分享了它。 </p><p> [一個家庭不能支付他們的賬單，所以城市帶他們的狗並在eBay上出售] </p><p>台灣有單支付系統 - 這意味著政府控制醫療支付，儘管大多數服務提供者和醫院都是私有化的。自由團體和官員越來越多地尋求單支付系統，以解決美國的高醫療費用和數百萬沒有保險的人。 </p><p>根據衛生事務部引用的數據，2017年美國約有17％的國內生產總值用於醫療保健 - 幾乎是其他發達國家平均8.8％的兩倍。根據醫療保險和醫療補助服務中心的數據，隨著醫療保健支出到2020年上升到GDP的近20％，這一數字預計會增加。 </p><p> Bozeat估計他在美國的治療，沒有保險，可能會花費數千美元。 </p><p> “但在台灣，我能夠獲得快速，優質的護理，與我在美國醫院獲得的相對較少的錢相比，”他說。 </p><p> [美國花在醫療保健上的兩倍於其他富裕國家的真正原因] </p><p>根據普林斯頓衛生政策研究分析師鄭秀梅的健康事務報告，台灣於1995年建立了單一支付者醫療保健系統。（鄭的已故丈夫，普林斯頓經濟學家和醫療保健專家Uwe Reinhardt，是20世紀80年代向該國推薦單支付系統的人。） </p><p>該國擁有約2400萬人口，是世界第19大經濟體;無論先前存在的條件如何，其99.9％的居民都參加了國家醫療保健計劃。 </p><p> “綜合福利包括住院和門診護理，精神保健，處方藥，牙科護理，中醫，透析和老年人日托，”Cheng說。 </p><p>她繼續說： </p><p>台灣約有6.1％的GDP用於醫療保健;在美國，發達國家的最高水平之一，約為17％。 </p><p>在一次採訪中，Cheng根據保險公司和政府機構的統計數據，舉例說明了美國與台灣之間的價格差異。 </p><p> Harvoni是一種治療丙型肝炎的藥物，台灣一個療程的費用為2,132美元;她說，在美國，同樣數額的平均成本為32,114美元。 </p><p>台灣的核磁共振成本為288美元;在美國，它是1,119美元。 </p><p>在香港的剖腹產費用為1,404美元;在美國，這是15,106美元。 </p><p>近年來，對台灣醫療體系的興趣不斷增加。陳說，她向參議員伯尼桑德斯（I-Vt。）介紹了該系統，並將在周五向加利福尼亞州立法者發表講話，同時廣泛推動該州的全民醫療保健。 </p><p> “人們羨慕[台灣]系統，因為他們花費了我們花費的三分之一，”她說。 “在成本覆蓋和效益方面，它的表現非常出色。許多國家都希望覆蓋所有人 - 他們希望將台灣的模式作為指南。“ </p><p>保守派智庫美國行動論壇主席兼美國國會預算辦公室前主任道格霍爾茲 - 埃金說，美國醫療保健費用膨脹的部分原因是“過度測試和利用不足等問題過度使用的模式”預防保健。“ </p><p> “你把它全部加起來，花了很多錢，”他說。 </p><p> Holtz-Eakin說最近一項關於價格的研究調查了23種藥物，發現它們在美國的成本比其他地方高出80％。 Holtz-Eakin說，在這項研究中，其他國家中仍有11種藥物可供使用。 </p><p> “因此，您在另一個國家支付的價格之一是您無法獲得某些診斷和治療，”他說。 “很難為此付出代價。” </p><p> [一名11歲的女子在被強姦後懇求墮胎。她被迫分娩。] </p><p> Cheng寫道，雖然一些擁有社會化醫療系統的國家，如加拿大和英國，因為某些程序等待時間過長而聞名，但台灣並沒有遇到這個問題。她強調了台灣和美國醫療保健系統之間的另一個顯著差異：台灣的行政成本遠低於美國。她說：“台灣人口2380萬人的NHI不足3000人。” </p><p> Bozeat在簡短的直接消息交流中表示，他認為他的帖子已經病毒化，因為它可能“讓大多數看到它的美國人感到震驚，特別是價格。” </p><p>他寫道：“我收到了大量直接信息和人們分享高額賬單的意見，保險費用。” “有些人也襲擊了我，稱我為騙子。儘管他們對台灣或其醫療保健系統一無所知。有趣的是，我得到了台灣人的大力支持，感謝我們讚揚他們的醫療保健系統。“ </p><p>他跟隨另一個病毒哨所跟踪了全民醫療保健的請求。 </p><p> “台灣不如美國富裕，但它花費更少，從醫療系統中獲得更多。我們看到同樣的故事重演，“他寫道。 “這場辯論非常無聊，因為沒有辯論。通用醫療保健工作，可以在這裡完成，可以在任何有足夠資源的國家完成。我們所需要的只是政治意願和實施計劃。“ </p>'),(204,9,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/taiwans-2020-election-campaigns-are-already-kicking-off-its-all-about-the-us-and-china/2019/02/24/9771600e-36a8-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html','Taiwan\'s 2020 election campaign is already kicking off.

Beijing is increasingly exporting its repression to free societies, including by attempting to force Western corporations such as airlines to erase the word “Taiwan” from their websites.</p><p>“Changing the name of Taiwan is not only about Taiwan, it’s about bending democracies’ will,” Hsu said. “I think everyone in democracies around the world should wake up to that.”</p><p>No one is advocating for regime change policies in China, but the Chinese people’s demands for greater freedoms are not going away, either. As the famous Chinese democracy activist Wei Jingsheng wrote in “The Fifth Modernization,” a 1978 document that cost him 18 years in prison and permanent exile:</p><p>“People should have democracy. When they ask for democracy, they are only demanding what is rightfully theirs. Anyone refusing to give it to them is a shameless bandit no better than a capitalist who robs workers of their money earned with their sweat and blood. Do the people have democracy now? No. Do they want to be masters of their own destiny? Definitely yes.”</p><p>Trump will never be a champion of democracy. But the least he could do is avoid praising Xi for grabbing power and then bragging about that to a group of donors. He’s working against the interests of both the Chinese people and the United States.</p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qcQ5lNwUrJcNYe2avGWm-MarXPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLHCXBC6IMI6RNSWENWGEFHPAE.jpg','[\"402\", \"213\", \"167\"]',1,'為什麼美國不應該歡迎中國的“國王”','null','“對於台灣人民對中國成為民主國家的反應，我們祝賀中國人民能夠享受與台灣同樣的自由和人權保護，”吳說。','<p>特朗普總統似乎迷戀中國越來越專制的觀點。他週二晚上對觀眾說，他稱讚中國國家主席習近平是中國的“國王”。 </p><p> “他說，&#39;但我不是國王，我是總統。&#39;我說&#39;不，你是終身總統，因此你就是國王，&#39;“特朗普在2017年的北京之行中回憶道。 “他說，呵呵。他很喜歡。我和他相處得很好。“ </p><p>特朗普講述這個故事的方式，他似乎很羨慕中國政府在2018年3月改變了憲法，取消了對總統的任期限制，基本上允許習近平永久地繼續擔任中國政府首腦。 </p><p>但中國對極權統治的穩定下滑恰恰與美國和世界的利益完全相反，更不用說中國人民了。習近平及其同伴的權力集中與中國共產黨不斷上升的內部鎮壓和外部侵略密切相關。 </p><p>上週在台灣舉行的新聞獎學金 - 地球上唯一講中文的民主 - 我國代表團問外交大臣約瑟夫吳，如果中國要成為一個民主而不是獨裁，會發生什麼。 </p><p> “如果我們考慮中國有可能將自己變為民主國家，我認為這對世界其他國家來說是一種福氣，”吳說。 </p><p>吳認為，民主中國更注重自身的內部發展，而不是擴張主義。對於處於中國經濟，政治和外交侵略前線的台灣而言，民主中國的威脅性較小，而且不太有意向中國人民和世界說服台灣是他們需要恢復的領土。 </p><p> “對於台灣人民對中國成為民主國家的反應，我們祝賀中國人民能夠享受與台灣同樣的自由和人權保護，”吳說。 “這對他們來說是件好事。” </p><p>吳回答了一個關於假設情況的問題;沒有人認為中國的民主將很快爆發。 6月將是中國政府1989年在天安門廣場屠殺成千上萬民主人士的30週年紀念日，中共從此一直保持著自己的領先地位。 </p><p>但是，台灣的情況應該是對世界其他國家的警告，即中國打算破壞並最終侵蝕民主及其所代表的價值觀，吳說。 </p><p>他說：“台灣的民主是我們需要珍惜的東西，而中國的目的是摧毀台灣的民主。” “我們必須佔上風，因為我們必須向國際社會表明民主是人類更好的道路。” </p><p>當然，美國的官方外交政策是支持台灣的民主，推動中國的政治改革。 “台灣是一個民主的成功故事，一個可靠的伙伴和一個在世界上有益的力量，”國務卿邁克龐培在二月份說。 </p><p>但特朗普對習近平權力攫取的稱讚破壞了這一信息。吳說，專制政權的性質是外部侵略性和內部鎮壓，攻擊所有自由，包括宗教。 </p><p> “看看他們對天主教徒的鎮壓，”他說。 “這是因為教會是組織公眾的最佳方式，中國政府對此非常害怕。” </p><p>外交部副部長許士謙告訴我國代表團，中國日益增強的專制主義不僅是中國和台灣的問題，也是所有民主國家的問題。北京越來越多地將其壓制出口到自由社會，包括試圖迫使航空公司等西方公司從其網站上刪除“台灣”一詞。 </p><p> “改變台灣的名稱不僅僅是關於台灣，而是關於民主國家的意志，”許說。 “我認為全世界民主國家的每個人都應該醒悟過來。” </p><p>沒有人主張中國的政權更迭政策，但中國人民對更大自由的要求也不會消失。正如著名的中國民主活動家魏京生在“第五次現代化”中所寫的那樣，1978年的一份文件使他喪生18年並永久流亡： </p><p> “人們應該擁有民主。當他們要求民主時，他們只是要求他們理所當然的。任何拒絕給予他們的人都是一個無恥的土匪，並不比資本家剝奪工人用汗水和血液賺來的錢更好。人民現在有民主嗎？不，他們想成為自己命運的主人嗎？肯定是的。“ </p><p>特朗普永遠不會成為民主的擁護者。但至少他能做的就是避免讚美習近平奪取權力，然後向一群捐贈者吹噓。他反對中國人民和美國的利益。 </p>'),(206,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/18/chinas-xi-jinping-is-growing-impatient-with-taiwan-adding-tensions-with-united-states/','China\'s Xi Jinping is growing impatient with Taiwan, adding to tensions with U.S.','null','” For its part, the United States’ one-China policy acknowledges Beijing’s position that there is only one China, but Washington has never taken a position on whether Taiwan belongs to the People’s Republic of China.','John Pomfret','1550524026000',1550524026000,'<p>As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election less than a year from now, it looks increasingly likely that the island democracy risks replaying its traditional role as a flash point in U.S.-China relations.</p><p>On Feb. 7, a group of four Republican senators called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to invite Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, to address a joint session of Congress — a move that would enrage Beijing. Hard-line Chinese analysts have issued a report advocating that Beijing take a page from American policy in Venezuela and recognize as Taiwan’s next president any candidate who supports unification. In Taiwan, a group of uncompromising independence activists are lobbying their government to “create [an] independent state and advance towards being a normal country” next year. Beijing has warned that any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan would result in war.</p><p>These maneuvers are occurring against a backdrop of a deteriorating relationship between the Trump administration and Beijing, and as China’s president, Xi Jinping, seems anxious for movement on Taiwan.</p><p>Beijing has always claimed that Taiwan is part of China and has never dropped its threat to use force to “unite the motherland.” For its part, the United States’ one-China policy acknowledges Beijing’s position that there is only one China, but Washington has never taken a position on whether Taiwan belongs to the People’s Republic of China. What’s more, under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed in 1979, the United States is legally obligated to provide for Taiwan’s defense.</p><p>For decades, Chinese officials privately argued that with time and Chinese economic growth Taiwan would have no choice but to accept China’s embrace. Now Chinese analysts are far more pessimistic. First, there had been an assumption in some circles that China’s political system would evolve into a more liberal one, making a confederation with China a palpable option for many on Taiwan. But instead, China today is more repressive than at any time since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests around Tiananmen Square.</p><p>Second, many Taiwanese have been turned off by China’s handling of Hong Kong, which they see as a harbinger of things to come in Taiwan should China take control. China absorbed the former British colony in 1997, promising — under the slogan “one country, two systems” — to let it maintain its unique economic system for 50 years and pledging to allow more democracy. Twenty-two years into Chinese rule and Beijing has not significantly expanded democracy in Hong Kong and has begun to meddle openly in the internal affairs of the territory.</p><p>Finally, after almost 30 years of democratization in Taiwan, many Taiwanese have discovered a unique identity and have no interest in unifying with Beijing. In 1992, when democracy just began in Taiwan, only 20 percent of the respondents to an annual poll held by Taiwan’s National Chengchi University called themselves “Taiwanese only.” In 2018, more than 50 percent did so. And those who identified solely as Chinese dropped from a quarter of those asked in 1992 to less than 3 percent last year.</p><p>Faced with these trends, Xi has apparently decided that saber rattling is better than a soft touch. On Jan. 2, in his first major speech on Taiwan since taking over the leadership of the Communist Party in 2012, he warned that the Taiwan “problem” could not be put off for another generation and threatened the island with attack. He also demanded that any talks between Taiwan and China must be carried out with both sides acknowledging that the ultimate goal would be unification. Xi’s speech prompted a rarely seen show of political unity in Taiwan. Both President Tsai, who represents the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, and the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, rejected Xi’s demands.</p><p>Xi’s tougher line has garnered support among hard-liners in China. In a report given to me by a prominent hard-liner who requested anonymity, one group suggested somewhat implausibly that should China decide to attack Taiwan, it could persuade Russia, North Korea and Iran to join the fight. The report also advocated launching an economic embargo on Taiwan by first drawing up a list of Taiwanese independence supporters and blocking them from doing business in China.</p><p>The Financial Times recently reported that officials from China’s Taiwan Affairs Council have been calling in mainland-based Taiwanese business executives and Taiwanese students for discussions on Taiwan’s fate. Taiwanese who participated in these sessions described them as a way to gauge the political reliability of Taiwanese living in China. The hard-liners’ report called on the Chinese government to find a leader on Taiwan willing to accept Chinese rule recognize him or her, as the United States has with Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó.</p><p>This type of extremism has echoes in Taiwan, where independence activists are chafing at Tsai’s moderate stance. Following defeats for the Democratic Progressive Party in local elections in November, independence advocates, led by Kuo Pei-hung, chairman of pro-independence Formosa TV, established an organization called the Formosa Alliance to push independence and organize a referendum on the topic.</p><p>Back in Washington, support for Taiwan is at its highest since the passing of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. Former diplomat Richard C. Bush, now at the Brookings Institution, predicted that inviting Taiwan’s president to Congress would inflame Beijing. Others are less alarmed.</p><p>Regardless, Taiwan, which has lain dormant for years as an issue between the United States and China, is back.</p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rSl5Z_4dZHeDCEjo9WkWo4klHXQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWKMMKBIW4I6TEDOTVK3MRI6WQ.jpg','[\"103\", \"115\", \"353\"]',7,'中國習近平對台灣越來越不耐煩，加劇了對美國的緊張局勢','null','“就其本身而言，美國的一個中國政策承認北京的立場，即只有一個中國，但華盛頓從未對台灣是否屬於中華民國採取立場。','<p>由於台灣準備在不到一年的時間內舉行總統大選，島內民主似乎越來越有可能重新扮演美中關係的傳統角色。 </p><p> 2月7日，一群四名共和黨參議員呼籲眾議院議長南希佩洛西（加利福尼亞州民主黨）邀請台灣總統蔡英文在國會聯席會議上發表講話 - 此舉將激怒北京。強硬的中國分析人士發表了一份報告，主張北京從委內瑞拉的美國政策中獲取一頁，並承認任何支持統一的候選人是台灣的下任總統。在台灣，一群不妥協的獨立活動家正在遊說他們的政府明年“創建一個獨立的國家並朝著正常的國家邁進”。北京警告說，台灣任何正式的獨立宣言都會導致戰爭。 </p><p>這些演習是在特朗普政府與北京之間關係惡化的背景下發生的，而中國國家主席習近平似乎對台灣運動感到擔憂。 </p><p>北京一直聲稱台灣是中國的一部分，並且從未放棄使用武力“團結祖國”的威脅。就其本身而言，美國的一個中國政策承認北京的立場，即只有一個中國，但華盛頓從來沒有對台灣是否屬於中華人民共和國採取立場。更重要的是，根據1979年簽署的“與台灣關係法”，美國在法律上有義務提供台灣的辯護。 </p><p>幾十年來，中國官員私下認為，隨著時間的推移和中國的經濟增長，台灣別無選擇，只能接受中國的擁抱。現在中國的分析師更加悲觀。首先，有些人認為中國的政治體制會演變成一個更自由的政治體系，這使得與中國的聯盟成為台灣許多人的明顯選擇。但相反，自1989年鎮壓天安門廣場周圍的民主抗議活動以來，今天的中國比任何時候都更加鎮壓。 </p><p>其次，許多台灣人因中國對香港的處理而被關閉，他們認為，如果中國控制下來，他們認為這是台灣未來事件的先兆。中國在1997年吸收了前英國殖民地，承諾 - 在“一國兩制”的口號下 - 讓它保持50年的獨特經濟體制，並承諾允許更多的民主。中國統治二十二年，北京沒有顯著擴大香港的民主，並開始公開干涉香港的內政。 </p><p>最後，經過近30年的台灣民主化，許多台灣人發現了一種獨特的身份，並沒有興趣與北京統一。 1992年民主剛剛在台灣開始時，台灣國立政治大學舉行的年度民意調查中，只有20％的受訪者稱自己為“只有台灣人”。2018年，超過50％的人這樣做。而那些僅僅認定為中國人的人，從1992年的四分之一下降到去年的不到3％。 </p><p>面對這些趨勢，習近平顯然認為劍拔弩張比柔軟觸感好。 1月2日，他在2012年接任共產黨領導人後首次就台灣問題發表重要講話時警告說，台灣“問題”不能推遲到另一代，並威脅台灣受到攻擊。他還要求台灣與中國之間的任何會談必須在雙方承認最終目標是統一的情況下進行。習近平的講話引發了台灣罕見的政治統一表現。代表獨立民主進步黨的蔡總統和主要的反對黨國民黨都拒絕了習近平的要求。 </p><p>習更強硬的陣容得到了中國強硬派的支持。在一位不願透露姓名的著名強硬派給我的報告中，有一組人士有點不可思議地表示，如果中國決定攻擊台灣，它可以說服俄羅斯，朝鮮和伊朗加入戰鬥。該報告還提倡對台灣實施經濟禁運，首先制定一份台灣獨立支持者名單，阻止他們在中國開展業務。 </p><p>英國“金融時報”最近報導稱，中國台灣事務委員會的官員一直在呼籲駐有大陸的台灣企業高管和台灣學生就台灣的命運進行討論。參加這些會議的台灣人將其描述為衡量台灣居民在中國的政治可靠性的一種方式。強硬派的報告呼籲中國政府找到一個願意接受中國統治的台灣領導人，就像美國與委內瑞拉反對派領導人胡安·瓜伊多一樣。 </p><p>這種類型的極端主義在台灣有迴響，獨立活動家對台灣的溫和立場感到不滿。在民主進步黨於11月地方選舉中失敗之後，由獨立福爾摩沙電視台主席郭培雄領導的獨立倡導者成立了一個名為福爾摩沙聯盟的組織，以推動獨立並組織有關該主題的公投。 </p><p>回到華盛頓，自1979年“台灣關係法案”通過以來，對台灣的支持率最高。現任布魯金斯學會的前外交官理查德·布什預言，邀請台灣總統出任國會會激怒北京。其他人則不那麼驚慌。 </p><p>無論如何，台灣作為美國和中國之間的問題多年來一直處於休眠狀態。 </p>');

Inventory figures at Apple’s primary chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. were also high at the end of 2018, up 40 percent from a year earlier.</p><p>At the time, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told me that stockpiles consisted primarily of raw wafers and 7-nanometer chips in production. In layman’s terms: the basic ingredient upon which chips are built, and semiconductors made with the latest technology. In the fourth quarter, Apple was the primary client for such technology.</p><p>That revelation came soon after Apple cut its own outlook for the period, citing weaker demand. Impressively, the iPhone maker managed its inventory so well that the figure climbed a mere 12.8 percent at the end of December from a year earlier – one of the slowest clips in recent quarters, and in the face of falling sales.</p><p>My conclusion in January was that, to avoid holding inventory, Apple was pushing it back onto suppliers. Ho declined to name the client, but she said that customers may ask TSMC to keep product on its shelves (and books) even if a chip has finished production and passed all required tests.</p><p>Foxconn’s major subsidiary, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., takes a long time to report its financials, which is why we didn’t get to view its year-end numbers until now. Maybe this delay diminishes the usefulness of this data, or the situation has improved during the interceding first quarter.</p><p>Nevertheless, these Hon Hai figures are further evidence of Apple’s inventory strategy.</p><p>The Chinese government also looks to be inadvertently helping Apple trim its stockpiles. In March Beijing announced it would cut the value-added tax rate to help buoy the economy. Apple started passing those savings on to consumers, Caixing reported, citing data from e-commerce companies and Apple’s own China website. The company already lowered prices in February, but the levy cut allowed it to trim again with a minimal hit to margins.</p><p>Over the past few months, suppliers throughout the hardware sector have spoken of moves to lower output in order to digest excess inventory.

It’s a country of just 4 million people but its canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans makes it one of the world’s busiest trade arteries and strategically important both to Washington and Beijing.</p><p>As American officials express alarm at Beijing’s ambitions in the U.S.-dominated Western Hemisphere, China has launched a charm offensive, wooing Panamanian politicians, professionals and journalists.</p><p>The Chinese ambassador, a Spanish-speaking Latin American veteran, has been talking up the benefits of Belt and Road on TV and Twitter. Beijing has flown professionals and journalists on junkets to China. It seems to be paying off.</p><p>“We see a big opportunity to connect Asia and America to Panama,” Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela said during a visit to Hong Kong this week. He is due to attend a “Belt and Road” forum in Beijing with other foreign leaders this month, according to the Chinese government.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign initiative, Belt and Road is building railways, ports, power plants and other projects in dozens of countries around the globe. But the U.S., Japan, Russia, India and other governments fret that Beijing is gaining economic and strategic influence at their expense.</p><p>“A strong U.S. reaction, whether it is obvious in public or not, is coming,” said Matt Ferchen, an expert on China-Latin America relations at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.</p><p>Panama’s leaders see China as a source of trade and investment but want to avoid conflict with Washington. Varela has said Panama’s relationship with China “will not affect relations with our strategic partner.”</p><p>Belt and Road is building on multibillion dollar deals for loans and investments in oil and mining in South America that Beijing made beginning in the 1990s.</p><p>Venezuela has received $62 billion in Chinese loans. Brazil owes $42 billion and Argentina $18 billion. Ecuador has borrowed $17 billion.</p><p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he is considering joining Belt and Road. That would give it a foothold in a country bordering the U.S.</p><p>In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago agreed last May to take part. In September, a state-owned Chinese company was awarded a contract to build a dry dock.</p><p>American officials say governments should be wary.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited in October and met with Varela, whose term runs through July. Afterward, Pompeo told reporters Panama “should keep its eyes wide open” concerning Chinese investments.</p><p>“We are all concerned about China and by the way that China is entering those countries,” Pompeo said at the Group of 20 meeting of major economies in Argentina in December. Such projects are not always driven by “good intentions,” he said.</p><p>In a coup for Beijing, Panama switched diplomatic recognition in June 2017 to China from Taiwan, the self-ruled island the communist mainland claims as its own territory. That cut Taiwan’s biggest political tie to Latin America.</p><p>President Donald Trump’s “America first” policies are not helping the U.S. cause in the region, said businessman Roberto Eisenmann, founder of Panama’s most influential newspaper, La Prensa.</p><p>Trump has yet to name a replacement for U.S. Ambassador John Feeley, who announced his retirement in January 2018.</p><p>“They are leaving a vacuum of leadership that obviously the Chinese are trying to fill,” said Eisenmann.</p><p>Two months after Pompeo stopped by, Varela welcomed Xi on an official visit and proclaimed his support for Belt and Road. Varela told Xi that Panama wants to “play a front-line role” in helping to build a more interconnected world.</p><p>The next day, Varela joined a ceremony where a consortium including two Chinese companies was awarded a contract to build a fourth bridge across the Panama Canal, whose ports of entry at its Atlantic and Pacific ends are operated by a Hong Kong consortium.</p><p>China, the canal’s second-largest user after the United States, has “considerable strategic interest” in Panama, said Margaret Myers, director of Asia and Latin America for the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington.</p><p>“There are concerns about the possible effects on U.S. firms, on regional stability and, above all, on U.S. influence in the region,” she said.</p><p>Launched in 2012, Belt and Road now encompasses most Chinese commercial initiatives abroad.</p><p>Most projects involve Chinese loans at commercial interest rates, adding to concerns Beijing is building a China-centered trade and political structure that might leave poor countries with too much debt.</p><p>Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia and some other countries have canceled or renegotiated projects due to costs or complaints they would do too little for local economies.</p><p>China has dismissed such concerns .</p><p>Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, said Beijing is trying to reshape how the initiative is perceived. But there’s no indication it is addressing problems that led to complaints that Sri Lanka, Kenya and other countries ended up with too much debt.</p><p>“I don’t think they have learned the important lessons,” said Tsang. “What they have learned are the superficial ones.”</p><p>China’s ambassador, Wei Qiang, has been laying groundwork for deeper involvement in Panama.</p><p>In March 2018, he met with members of the opposition Revolutionary Democratic Party, whose candidate for this May’s presidential election, Laurentino Cortizo, is leading in polls.</p><p>Cortizo said he plans to meet with Wei to “look at the future of this relationship.”</p><p>Wei has invited Eisenmann, the newspaper founder, to his official residence to discuss Panama’s “plans for the ‘Silk Road’.”</p><p>China has proposed building a high-speed rail line from Panama City to the town of David near its western border with Costa Rica.</p><p>So far, projects awarded to Chinese contractors — the canal bridge, a cruise ship dock and a convention center — have been paid for by the Panamanian government.

They seem pure and natural, even if they are the end product of centuries of hybridizing in Japan.</p><p>The tree canopies spread agreeably with age, and by blooming in unison (as clones) they create an enchanting blush-white cloud that floats above the water. When they are done, they fall in an extended shower of confetti that is nothing short of magical.</p><p>This monocultural artistic effect comes with some risk: If you plant the genetically identical plant en masse, you are raising the risk of it being wiped out by a new pest or disease. But that view is probably too dire; on paper cherry trees are beset with all manner of pernicious maladies, and yet they survive. The biggest threat to the Potomac Park cherry trees is us; all those feet squash the life out of the soil and the roots.</p><p>The short-lived blossoms are viewed in their native land as a symbol of the fleeting nature of our lives. The challenge of the Tidal Basin Yoshinos is in trying to meditate on this profundity in the company of thousands of other cherry-peepers. Many are, no doubt, sensitive types seeking a soulful experience, but others lack introspective sensibilities, and some believe an experience is only real if it is seen through the veil of a smartphone.</p><p>On balance, the hordes are all to the good. The greater the number of people connecting to nature, the better the prospects for the planet, I say.</p><p>And it is not just in Washington where mass plantings of trees produce appreciative crowds. In her new book, “The Sakura Obsession,” Naoko Abe recounts the ritual of cherry-viewing or hanami. Her journalist colleagues in Tokyo would send an assistant to stake out a spot under the trees in the afternoon, and by the evening, they had joined him for a raucous, sake-fueled celebration. Across the land, millions do the same.</p><p>From a gardener’s perspective, the surfeit of Yoshinos means we may be missing out on all the other Japanese flowering cherry tree selections, hybrids and varieties that are waiting to please us. Some of these cherries, I point out, are inferior to Yoshino. The weeping ones grafted high on a cherry stick live up to their name. When I see one, I want to weep.</p><p>More than 10 percent of the trees in Potomac Park are of the mid-April flowering Kwanzan or Kanzan cherry, which to my mind is a dud: too coarse in structure, too blowzy in its double flower, too strong in color. The flower effect is diluted by the burgeoning foliage. If the Yoshino draws us to the Elysian fields, the Kwanzan barks the penny arcade.</p><p>If I were to plant a cherry tree, I might pick Accolade, a hybrid between the Sargent and Higan cherry that is vigorous and yet delicate in its blushed, semi-double blossoms.</p><p>Dream Catcher is more upright in habit than Yoshino (useful for small urban gardens) and as a seedling selection of the Okame cherry blooms earlier, as well.</p><p>Helen Taft, named after the first lady behind the Tidal Basin plantings, is a cross between the Yoshino and Taiwan cherries. It blooms at the very threshold of spring and is smothered in pale pink single blossoms that darken after a few days.</p><p>First Lady, another in the series, is strongly upright with dark glossy leaves and abundant dark rose-pink blooms redolent of the Taiwan cherry. This hybrid, which grows to 27 feet high and 14 feet across after 20 years, has proven the most popular, Pooler says.</p><p>The reliance on Yoshino is understandable, given its grace, and it has mesmerized not just Washington. In major public plantings in postwar Japan, the Yoshino became predominant. Abe is not entirely happy with this. In her book she points out that some 400 varieties of cherry have been bred from a handful of species over the past 1,200 years. Most of the world knew nothing of these beauties until Japan opened to the West in the mid-19th century. Suddenly confronted with these treasures, cities such as Washington naturally went crazy for them.</p><p>She recounts almost 50 cherry varieties. Her beef isn’t with Yoshinos, per se, but the fact that a militarized Japan in the 1920s and 1930s co-opted the plant as a symbol of noble death in the service of a belligerent state. On the eve of their mission, kamikaze pilots would get together and sing “Doki no Sakura” — Cherry Blossom Brothers.</p><p>But the book’s main and happier thrust is the recognition of an English plantsman — Collingwood Ingram — who became a noted guardian of the Japanese flowering cherry from his garden in Kent. He introduced some 50 varieties to the West and bred the Okame cherry tree, favored for its upright habit and early flowering. Perhaps his greatest feat was in preserving the Great White cherry and returning it to Japan, where it was known as Taihaku and then lost to cultivation. It is noted for its large, single white blossoms.</p><p>His initial efforts to send scions to Japan failed — they arrived dried out and dead. But he sent another batch embedded in potatoes, and they survived. There you have it, an Englishman using a South American tuber to restore an ancient Asian cherry to its homeland. That has to be a message about the power of the cherry tree to bring people together. The same cherry blossom dance is afoot, joyfully, this week on the banks of the Potomac.</p><p>@adrian_higgins on Twitter </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RXBJ4Q0xr2Rf7lCVzhlMAIg_5K0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D76RVTR7REI6TE3BGAP7WW6V4Y.jpg','[\"402\", \"3\", \"4\"]',1,'Yoshinos不是那裡唯一的櫻桃。值得了解和發展這些其他人。','null','現在位於潮汐盆地周圍的寧靜花卉中的日本櫻花樹大部分是19世紀東京的一種植物的克隆，並命名為Somei-Yoshino。','<p>現在位於潮汐盆地周圍的寧靜花卉中的日本櫻花樹大部分是19世紀東京的一種植物的克隆，並命名為Somei-Yoshino。 </p><p>很容易看出他們的吸引力;每朵花朵都由一個簡單的奶油色的花瓣環組成，周圍是黃色的雄蕊。它們看似純淨自然，即使它們是日本幾個世紀的混合產品的最終產品。 </p><p>樹冠與年齡一致，並且通過一致的盛開（如克隆），它們創造了一種漂浮在水面上的迷人的腮紅白雲。當它們完成後，它們會長時間地落入五彩紙屑中，這絕對是神奇的。 </p><p>這種單一文化的藝術效果帶來了一些風險：如果你種植基因相同的植物，你就會增加被新的害蟲或疾病消滅的風險。但這種觀點可能太可怕了;在紙櫻桃樹上，各種惡毒的疾病都被困擾著，然而它們卻活了下來。對波托馬克公園櫻桃樹的最大威脅是我們;所有這些腳都將生命從土壤和根部擠出來。 </p><p>短暫的花朵在他們的故鄉被視為我們生活中短暫性質的象徵。潮汐盆地Yoshinos的挑戰在於試圖在成千上萬的其他櫻桃偷窺者的陪伴下冥想這種深刻的印象。毫無疑問，許多人都是尋求靈魂體驗的敏感類型，但其他人缺乏內省的敏感性，有些人認為只有通過智能手機的面紗才能看到體驗。 </p><p>總的來說，成群結隊都是好事。我說，與大自然相關的人數越多，地球的前景就越好。 </p><p>並且不僅僅是在華盛頓，大規模種植樹木會產生欣賞的人群。在她的新書“櫻花痴迷”中，安倍直子講述了觀賞櫻花或hanami的儀式。她在東京的記者同事會派一名助手在下午放下樹下的一個地方，到了晚上，他們和他一起參加了一場喧鬧，清酒的慶祝活動。在整個土地上，數百萬人也這樣做。 </p><p>從園丁的角度來看，Yoshinos的過剩意味著我們可能會錯過所有其他日本櫻花樹選擇，混合物和品種等待取悅我們。我指出，其中一些櫻桃不如吉野。在櫻桃棒上嫁接的那些哭泣的人辜負了他們的名字。當我看到一個，我想哭。 </p><p>波托馬克公園超過10％的樹木是4月中旬開花的Kwanzan或Kanzan櫻桃，在我看來它是一種啞：結構太粗，雙花太濃，顏色太濃。花朵效果被新生的葉子稀釋。如果吉野將我們帶到了伊利西亞的田野，那麼Kwanzan會吠叫便士街。 </p><p>如果我要種一棵櫻桃樹，我可能會選擇Accolade，它是Sargent和Higan櫻桃之間的混合物，在其紅暈半開花中充滿活力而又細膩。 </p><p> Dream Catcher的習慣比Yoshino（適用於小型城市花園）更為正直，也是早期的Okame櫻花盛開的苗木選擇。 </p><p> Helen Taft以潮汐盆地種植背後的第一夫人的名字命名，是吉野和台灣櫻桃之間的交叉。它在春天的臨界點開花，在淡粉色的單朵花中窒息，幾天后變暗。 </p><p>第一夫人，系列中的另一個，非常直立，有深色光澤的葉子和豐富的深玫瑰粉紅色的台灣櫻桃花。 Pooler說，這種混合物在20年後長到27英尺高，14英尺寬，已被證明是最受歡迎的。 </p><p>鑑於它的優雅，對吉野的依賴是可以理解的，並且它不僅讓華盛頓迷住了。在戰後日本的主要公共種植中，吉野成為主導。安倍對此並不完全滿意。在她的書中，她指出，在過去的1200年中，已經從少數幾種植物中培育出約400種櫻桃。直到19世紀中葉日本向西方開放之前，世界上大多數人都不知道這些美女。突然面對這些寶藏，像華盛頓這樣的城市自然而然地為他們瘋狂了。 </p><p>她講述了近50種櫻桃品種。她的牛肉本身並不與Yoshinos有關，但事實上，在20世紀20年代和30年代，一個軍事化的日本選擇該植物作為交戰國家服務中的高貴死亡的象徵。在他們的使命前夕，神風飛行員將聚在一起唱“Doki no Sakura” - 櫻花兄弟。 </p><p>但這本書的主要和更快樂的推動力是對英國植物人科林伍德（Collingwood Ingram）的認可，他從肯特郡的花園成為日本櫻花的著名守護者。他向西方介紹了約50個品種，並培育了Okame櫻花樹，因其正直的習性和早期開花而受到青睞。也許他最偉大的壯舉是保留大白櫻桃並將其送回日本，在那裡它被稱為Taihaku然後失去了種植。它以其大而單一的白色花朵而聞名。 </p><p>他最初將接穗送到日本的努力失敗了 - 他們已經乾涸而死了。但是他又寄了一批土豆，他們倖免於難。在那裡，你有一個英國人使用南美塊莖來恢復古老的亞洲櫻桃到它的家鄉。這必須是關於櫻桃樹將人們聚集在一起的力量的信息。本週，在波托馬克河畔，同樣的櫻花舞正在快樂地進行。 </p><p> Twitter上的@adrian_higgins </p>'),(211,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/26/when-it-comes-negotiating-with-china-devil-is-details/','When it comes to negotiating with China, the devil is in the details','null','” This noncommittal language was crucial, because Washington wanted to pursue its own One-China policy, whereby the United States acknowledged but did not accept either Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan or any Taiwanese claim to statehood.','Neil Thomas','1553625124000',1553625124000,'<p>President Trump may soon have himself a deal.</p><p>After years of criticizing China for “ripping us off” with “unfair trade practices,” and after a months-long trade war involving more than $360 billion in two-way tariffs, Trump is optimistic about announcing an economic accord with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit that could happen as early as late April.</p><p>The good news is that Trump’s negotiators appear to have won concessions from China on removing requirements for foreign firms to enter joint ventures with local entities and banning forced technology transfer.

Historian Enrico Fardella calls this normalization President Jimmy Carter’s “greatest success.” Indeed, the American opening to China was a key moment in the United States’ Cold War maneuvering against the Soviet Union.</p><p>However, on Jan. 3, 1979, Michel Oksenberg, a China specialist on the National Security Council, sent a remarkable memo to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s national security adviser, to warn about a “translation problem” in the normalization communique.</p><p>That problem boiled down to one word: “acknowledge.” In the 1972 Shanghai Communique, the foundational document of U.S.-China relations, the United States said that it “acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.”</p><p>This noncommittal language was crucial, because Washington wanted to pursue its own One-China policy, whereby the United States acknowledged but did not accept either Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan or any Taiwanese claim to statehood. Similarly, then, the normalization communique stated that the U.S. government “acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.”</p><p>But while the English word, “acknowledges,” is the same in both documents, in translation it turned into something different. The Shanghai Communique used the word-phrase “renshi dao” (认识到), which connotes knowledge and understanding, whereas the normalization communique used the verb “chengren” (承认), a stronger term that connotes recognition and assent.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>In his memo, Oksenberg informed Brzezinski that during the “hectic days” before the normalization communique was finalized, the National Security Council “never saw” the Chinese version of the text because it “worked entirely from the English.” Right before the normalization communique was released, the U.S. Liaison Office (USLO) in Beijing assured Oksenberg that there were “no problems” with the Chinese translation. Afterward, the USLO explained to Oksenberg that it had noticed the insertion of “chengren” but decided not to inform Washington, because Chinese officials used “several English-Chinese dictionaries” to argue that there was “no substantive significance” to the new translation.</p><p>Oksenberg disagreed. He worried that the administration had “tampered with the ‘holy writ’ of the Shanghai Communique” and that “more than a few linguists” would say that “chengren” “denotes a stronger acceptance of the Chinese position” than “renshi dao.” Oksenberg implied that, had he seen the draft Chinese text, Washington would have pushed back.</p><p>The ramifications of this change were potentially significant. U.S. supporters of the Taiwanese regime, which had built a formidable China lobby in Washington, could have seized on the more conciliatory Chinese phrasing to portray Carter administration officials as dupes and bolster resistance to normalization policies on Capitol Hill.</p><p>To avoid these minefields, Oksenberg recommended a three-pronged defense: First, both governments had “worked from the English text”; second, the U.S. view was “expressed in the English”; and third, “chengren” was used by other countries with China. Brzezinski underlined the words “expressed in the English” and wrote “Yes. ZB.” Then-Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher later confirmed during congressional debates that the United States would “regard the English text as being the binding text.”</p><p>Beijing, however, saw the Chinese text as equally binding. The Foreign Ministry’s official history of U.S.-China relations foregrounds the United States’ agreement to “chengren” — Beijing‘s view on Taiwan.</p><p>And the conflict wasn’t simply one of language. It seems that Beijing took advantage of the American preference for English-first negotiations to advance its own foreign policy goals. Shi Yanhua, a government translator who worked on the normalization communique, recalled years later that she was present when Zhang Wenjin, a senior diplomat who had helped draft the document, purposefully changed “renshi dao” to “chengren” because the latter term was “more in line” with Beijing’s policy on Taiwan. These facts contradicted the assurances provided to the USLO that the new translation had “no substantive significance.”</p><p>This disclosure indicates that the USLO’s failure to object to the new Chinese text was a blunder, one that could have either strained U.S.-Chinese relations or pinned the United States to a policy that it did not support.</p><p>Fortunately for Washington, the Chinese, preoccupied with domestic development and strategic competition with the Soviet Union and Vietnam, chose to do little as the United States turned its own understanding of the agreement into policy in the region. In April 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act created a legal basis for the de facto diplomatic relations that still exist between the United States and Taiwan. The Six Assurances offered to Taiwan in 1982 affirmed that the United States “would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.”</p><p>That does not mean, however, that China’s linguistic chicanery was meaningless. Domestically, it helped fortify the legitimacy of Beijing’s claim to Taiwan, supporting a version of China in which its Communist Party controls Taipei.</p><p>And the history of this mistake may not be over. As China seeks increasingly to “set the parameters of acceptable discourse” in global affairs, especially with regard to its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, the words of the normalization communique may still become potent weapons of statecraft, diplomatic ammunition in a potential (if contentious) case for sovereignty should Beijing ever decide to force the issue of reunification with Taiwan.</p><p>This blunder was not a one-off occurrence. Over the past 40 years, Western observers often overlooked what Beijing was saying about its national ambitions. The policy of engagement that Washington has pursued with China may have been its best option, but if successive administrations had taken Beijing’s words more seriously, the United States might have been more proactive in safeguarding the international order from the political, economic and security challenges posed by an authoritarian superpower — challenges that have necessitated a new trade agreement today.</p><p>With U.S.-China relations at their lowest ebb in two decades, and the two countries’ governments increasingly divided over issues of trade, technology, geopolitics and human rights, the normalization communique is a lesson in the overconfidence that led many Americans to overlook Chinese intentions.</p><p>The Trump administration must not let China pull another fast one as it translates this new agreement. Because, for Beijing, reality is not “expressed in the English.”</p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qcQ5lNwUrJcNYe2avGWm-MarXPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLHCXBC6IMI6RNSWENWGEFHPAE.jpg','[\"111\", \"3\", \"144\"]',1,'談到與中國談判時，魔鬼就是細節','null','“這種不置可否的語言至關重要，因為華盛頓希望奉行自己的一個中國政策，即美國承認但不接受北京對台灣主權的主張或任何台灣人聲稱建國。','<p>特朗普總統可能很快就會達成協議。 </p><p>經過多年批評中國以“不公平的貿易行為”“扯掉我們”，經過長達數月的雙邊關稅超過3600億美元的貿易戰，特朗普對與中國國家主席習近平宣布經濟協議持樂觀態度。在4月底可能會發生的峰會上。 </p><p>好消息是特朗普的談判代表似乎已經從中國獲得讓步，取消了外國公司與當地實體建立合資企業和禁止強制技術轉讓的要求。他們也正在採取執法機制，最終可能採取措施遏制中國猖獗的知識產權盜竊和保護主義，每年造成美國公司損失500億美元。 </p><p>但仍有很多工作要做，尤其是北京方面將協議草案翻譯成中文，因為雙方迄今只用英語進行操作。許多觀察家擔心，中國可以通過在最終文本中插入模糊語言來減少其承諾。由於在20世紀70年代後期關於美中正常化的談判表明，特朗普政府必須警惕警惕中國文本的忠誠，以免它成為破壞交易的後門工具。 </p><p> 1978年12月，美國外交官急於使與中國的雙邊關係正常化，因此允許北京方面對中華人民共和國建交聯合公報的重要變化進行了重大修改。這個正常化的公報被譽為“歷史性的發展”，標誌著三十年的孤立和美國對台灣的正式認可，這是一個北京認為是叛徒的自治島嶼。歷史學家恩里科·法爾德拉稱這種正常化的總統吉米·卡特“取得了最大的成功。”事實上，美國對中國的開放是美國冷戰對蘇聯的關鍵時刻。 </p><p>然而，1979年1月3日，國家安全委員會中國問題專家米歇爾·奧克森伯格向卡特國家安全顧問茲比格涅夫·布熱津斯基發送了一份非凡的備忘錄，以警告正常化公報中的“翻譯問題”。 </p><p>這個問題歸結為一個詞：“承認。”在1972年的上海公報中，美中關係的基礎文件，美國說它“承認台灣海峽兩邊的所有中國人都認為只有一個中國和台灣是中國的一部分。“ </p><p>這種不置可否的語言至關重要，因為華盛頓希望奉行自己的一個中國政策，即美國承認但不接受北京對台灣的主權主張或任何台灣人聲稱建國。同樣，正常化公報指出，美國政府“承認中國的立場，即只有一個中國，台灣是中國的一部分”。 </p><p>但是，雖然英文單詞“承認”在兩篇文章中都是相同的，但在翻譯中卻變成了不同的東西。上海公報使用詞語“renshi dao”（認識到），它意味著知識和理解，而規範化公報使用動詞“chengren”（承認），這是一個強有力的術語，意味著承認和同意。 </p><p>這怎麼發生的？ </p><p>在他的備忘錄中，奧克森伯格告知布熱津斯基，在正常化公報最終確定之前的“忙碌日子”中，國家安全委員會“從未見過”中文版本的文本，因為它“完全來自英語。”正常化公報前美國聯絡辦公室（USLO）在北京向Oksenberg表示，中文翻譯“沒有問題”。之後，USLO向Oksenberg解釋說它注意到了“chengren”的插入，但決定不通知華盛頓，因為中國官員使用“幾個英漢詞典”來證明新翻譯“沒有實質意義”。 </p><p> Oksenberg不同意。他擔心政府“篡改了上海公報的&#39;聖令”，並且“不止一些語言學家”會說“成人”“表示”更強烈地接受中國的立場“，而不是”renshi dao“。奧克森伯格暗示，如果他看到中文文本草案，華盛頓會推遲。 </p><p>這種變化的後果可能很重要。台灣政權的美國支持者，曾在華盛頓建立了一個強大的中國遊說團體，本可以抓住更加和解的中國措辭，將卡特政府官員描述為愚蠢行為，並加強對國會山正常化政策的抵制。 </p><p>為了避免這些雷區，奧克森伯格建議採取三管齊下的防禦措施：首先，兩國政府都“按照英文文本進行工作”;第二，美國的觀點是“用英語表達”;第三，“chengren”被其他國家用於中國。布熱津斯基強調了“用英語表達”這幾個字，並寫道：“是的。 ZB。“當時的副國務卿沃倫克里斯托弗後來在國會辯論中證實，美國會”將英文文本視為具有約束力的文本“。 </p><p>然而，北京認為中文文本同樣具有約束力。外交部官方歷史上的美中關係突顯了美國與“成人”的協議 - 北京對台灣的看法。 </p><p>衝突不僅僅是語言之一。似乎北京利用美國傾向於英國首次談判來推進自己的外交政策目標。從事規範化公報工作的政府翻譯石燕華幾年後回憶說，當曾幫助起草該文件的高級外交官張文金故意將“renshi dao”改為“chengren”時，她出席了，因為後者是“更符合“北京對台政策”。這些事實與向USLO提供的保證相矛盾，即新翻譯“沒有實質意義”。 </p><p>這一披露表明，USLO未能反對新的中文文本是一個大錯，可能是美中關係緊張，也不是美國的政策不支持。 </p><p>華盛頓幸運的是，由於美國將自己對該協議的理解轉變為該地區的政策，因此中國人專注於國內發展以及與蘇聯和越南的戰略競爭。 1979年4月，“與台灣關係法”為美國與台灣之間仍然存在的事實上的外交關係創造了法律基礎。 1982年向台灣提出的六項保證確認美國“不會正式承認中國對台灣的主權”。 </p><p>然而，這並不意味著中國的語言詭計毫無意義。在國內，它有助於鞏固北京對台灣主張的合法性，支持其共產黨控制台北的中國版本。 </p><p>而這個錯誤的歷史可能還沒有結束。隨著中國越來越多地在全球事務中“設定可接受的話語參數”，特別是在其對台灣主權的主張方面，正規化公報的話語仍然可能成為政治的有力武器，外交彈藥具有潛力（如果有爭議的話）如果北京決定強迫與台灣重新統一的話，主權問題應該得到解決。 </p><p>這個錯誤不是一次性的。在過去的40年裡，西方觀察家經常忽略了北京對其國家野心的看法。華盛頓與中國的接觸政策可能是最好的選擇，但如果歷屆政府更認真地對待北京的話，美國可能會更積極地保護國際秩序免受政治，經濟和安全方面的挑戰。一個專制的超級大國 - 今天需要達成新貿易協議的挑戰。 </p><p>由於美中關係處於二十年來最低潮，兩國政府在貿易，技術，地緣政治和人權等問題上日益分化，正規化公報是過度自信的一個教訓，導致許多美國人忽視了中國的意圖。 </p><p>特朗普政府在翻譯這項新協議時，絕不能讓中國再次採取快速措施。因為，對北京而言，現實並非“用英語表達”。 </p>'),(212,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/23/taiwans-bikini-hiker-dies-after-falling-into-ravine-solo-trek/','Taiwan\'s \'bikini hiker\' dies after falling into ravine on solo trek','null','Wu relished hiking alone — something she thought everyone should be able to do — and frequently emphasized safety and responsible hiking practices in posts to her Facebook page dedicated to hiking, which had more than 20,000 followers.','Amy B Wang','1548268145000',1548268145000,'<p>If there was any doubt that hiking was Gigi Wu’s passion, a visit to her social media accounts would have put that to rest.</p><p>Her Facebook page was a veritable tour of Taiwan’s tallest peaks and most scenic mountain ranges.

This violated the long-held tacit agreement between China and Taiwan that neither side should cross the median line.</p><p>Taiwan deemed this “an intentional, reckless & provocative action,” which triggered “a 10-minute standoff” in the air. As Asia security expert Bonnie S. Glaser notes that, if intentional, this would be the first PLAAF crossing of the median line in about 20 years. In this case, it’s likely that Taiwan, not the South China Sea, prompted Beijing’s actions.</p><p>An unresolved issue from the Chinese civil war, Taiwan has always been a “core interest” to party leaders in Beijing. Here are some key takeaways from my research on China-Taiwan relations.</p><h3>What does the PLAAF move signal?</h3><p>Granted, there is much we don’t know about this specific PLAAF incident. But my work on cross-Strait relations suggests that it’s quite possible the PLAAF behavior is intentional — and serves as a coercive signal to Taiwan and the United States. Here’s what you need to know:</p><h3>1. The U.S. agreed to sell fighter jets to Taiwan. </h3><p>In March, the United States agreed to sell F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan — the fourth-generation model. The last U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan took place in September 1992.</p><p>[China-U.S.-Taiwan relations are in choppy waters. Here’s what’s going on.]</p><p>Beijing considers selling weapons platforms such as jet fighters and submarines to Taiwan an implicit red line. In the past, China used coercion to deter countries from selling these weapons platforms to Taiwan. This suggests that last week’s PLAAF incident is intended to send a deterrent signal about fighter sales to both Taiwan and the United States.</p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Defense lodged protests against the United States regarding the sale, reiterating that China will “take all necessary measures” to resolutely defend its sovereignty. The Trump administration decided on April 5 to put on hold the F-16V deal until the United States strikes a trade deal with China, suggesting that China may have used the bilateral trade talks as a bargaining chip.</p><h3>2. U.S. ships were in the Taiwan Strait. </h3><p>On March 24, U.S. naval and Coast Guard ships passed through the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese Foreign Ministry protested, urging the United States to exercise caution.</p><h3>3. Taiwan’s president stopped off in Hawaii. </h3><p>That same week, Tsai Ing-wen made a U.S. stopover. China protested that this was in violation of the “one China” policy, which calls for the United States and other countries to refrain from official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</p><p>These actions appear to be relatively minor provocations in China’s ledger. But to Beijing, not taking coercive actions to demonstrate its resolve might produce more provocative actions from Taiwan and the United States in the future.</p><h3>How does China use its tools of coercion?</h3><p>In the past, China has utilized both military and nonmilitary tools to force Taiwan and other countries to stop and deter actions that China deems threatening. My book project suggests that China uses these tools selectively. And Beijing tends to target the United States less, because of China’s economic vulnerability vis-a-vis the United States.</p><p>[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]</p><p>Here’s an example. When France sold Mirage 2000 fighter jets Taiwan in 1992, China responded with harsh diplomatic and economic sanctions, including a ban on French wheat exports to China, awarding a subway bid in China’s southern city of Guangzhou to Germany, freezing a French project to build a nuclear power plant in China and closing the French consulate in Guangzhou.</p><p>In this case, China had “exit options.” For instance, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were all bidding on the Guangzhou subway project. The Chinese ambassador to France stated in his memoir that China turned to Germany to sanction France.</p><h3>Fear of U.S. economic retaliation held China back in 1992.</h3><p>Concerns about U.S.-China economic relations kept Beijing from giving a similar response after the 1992 U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan. Just 12 days after the sale, Congress passed a bill linking Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status with Chinese human rights conditions.</p><p>Evidence from my working paper reveals that Chinese government analysts during the 1992 F-16 episode waited anxiously. Would President George H.W. Bush veto the conditional extension of MFN status — and would Congress then overturn the veto? Bush eventually vetoed the bill, 26 days after the sale.</p><p>Losing MFN status would be detrimental to China’s exports, a former World Bank official in charge of China confirmed to me. And China and the United States were slated to engage in market entry negotiations three weeks after the weapons sales. The U.S. trade representative threatened 100 percent tariffs on $4 billion worth of Chinese goods if the two sides did not reach an agreement.</p><p>[The U.S. and China are playing a dangerous game. What comes next?]</p><p>China expert John W. Garver writes that Deng Xiaoping endorsed an internal Chinese Foreign Ministry report at the time, because “China needed to give priority to economic interests” and avoid a trade war in which Beijing stood to lose the most.</p><p>By 1994, President Clinton had delinked MFN status from Chinese human rights conditions. China subsequently responded with coercion in 1995 when Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui gave a talk at Cornell University and Taiwan held elections in 1996. Beijing conducted missile tests and recalled the Chinese ambassador to the United States.</p><p>These measures, Beijing hoped, would deter the United States and other countries from granting Lee a visa in the future, which China perceived as supporting Taiwan’s path toward de jure independence.</p><p>In this light, President Tsai Ing-wen’s recent transit via Hawaii and meetings with senior U.S. leaders could be a contributing factor to China’s reactions. Barring an official invitation for the Taiwanese president to visit the United States, Chinese coercion regarding these transits probably will focus on Taiwan. China’s goal, most likely, is to deter Taiwanese leaders from transiting via the United States or meeting with senior U.S. officials in the future.</p><p>China and Taiwan have long had a tense relationship. But as Chinese economic clout increased, Beijing began to threaten economic and diplomatic sanctions against U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan.

Glaser指出的那樣，如果是有意的話，這將是PLAAF在大約20年內首次穿越中線。在這種情況下，台灣而不是南中國海可能促使北京採取行動。 </p><p>作為中國內戰尚未解決的問題，台灣一直是北京黨內領導人的“核心利益”。以下是我對中台關係研究的一些重要內容。 </p><h3> PLAAF移動信號是什麼？ </h3><p>當然，我們還不了解這次具體的PLAAF事件。但我對兩岸關係的研究表明，中國空軍的行為很有可能是故意的 - 並且是對台灣和美國的強制性信號。這是你需要知道的： </p><h3>美國同意向台灣出售戰鬥機。 </h3><p> 3月，美國同意向台灣出售F-16V戰鬥機 - 第四代機型。美國最後一次向台灣出售F-16戰鬥機是在1992年9月。 </p><p> [中美台關係波動不定。這是正在發生的事情。] </p><p>北京認為向台灣出售噴氣式戰鬥機和潛艇等武器平台是一條隱含的紅線。過去，中國使用強製手段阻止各國向台灣出售這些武器平台。這表明，上週的PLAAF事件旨在向台灣和美國發出關於戰鬥機銷售的威懾信號。 </p><p>中國外交部和國防部就此次抗議向美國提出抗議，重申中國將“採取一切必要措施”堅決捍衛其主權。特朗普政府於4月5日決定暫停F-16V協議，直到美國與中國達成貿易協議，這表明中國可能將雙邊貿易談判作為討價還價的籌碼。 </p><h3>美國船隻在台灣海峽。 </h3><p> 3月24日，美國海軍和海岸警衛隊船隻通過台灣海峽。中國外交部抗議，敦促美國謹慎行事。 </p><h3>台灣總統在夏威夷停了下來。 </h3><p>同一周，蔡英文在美國中途停留。中國抗議這違反了“一個中國”的政策，這一政策要求美國和其他國家不要與台灣建立官方外交關係。 </p><p>這些行動在中國的分類賬中似乎是相對較小的挑釁。但對北京而言，未採取強制行動以表明其決心可能會在未來產生更多來自台灣和美國的挑釁行為。 </p><h3>中國如何使用其強製手段？ </h3><p>過去，中國利用軍事和非軍事工具迫使台灣和其他國家停止和阻止中國認為具有威脅性的行動。我的書項目表明，中國有選擇地使用這些工具。由於中國相對於美國的經濟脆弱性，北京往往較少針對美國。 </p><p> [一個更加自信的北京為美中關係提出新問題] </p><p>這是一個例子。當法國於1992年向台灣出售幻影2000戰鬥機時，中國採取嚴厲的外交和經濟制裁措施，包括禁止向中國出口法國小麥，在中國南方城市廣州向德國申請地鐵，凍結法國項目建設中國核電站關閉法國駐廣州領事館。 </p><p>在這種情況下，中國有“退出選擇權”。例如，法國，德國和英國都在競標廣州地鐵項目。中國駐法國大使在回憶錄中指出，中國轉向德國製裁法國。 </p><h3>對美國經濟報復的恐懼使中國重新回到了1992年。 </h3><p>在1992年美國向台灣出售F-16之後，對中美經濟關係的擔憂使得北京方面沒有做出類似回應。出售僅僅12天后，國會通過了一項法案，將最惠國（MFN）貿易地位與中國人權狀況聯繫起來。 </p><p>我工作文件的證據表明，1992年F-16期間中國政府分析人員焦急地等待著。美國總統布什總統否決有條件延長最惠國地位 - 國會是否會推翻否決權？在出售26天后，布什最終否決了這項法案。 </p><p>失去最惠國待遇將對中國的出口產生不利影響，前世界銀行負責中國的官員向我證實。中國和美國將在武器銷售三週後進行市場准入談判。如果雙方未達成協議，美國貿易代表將威脅對價值40億美元的中國商品徵收100％的關稅。 </p><p> [美國和中國正在玩一場危險的比賽。接下來是什麼？] </p><p>中國專家約翰·加弗寫道，鄧小平當時贊同中國外交部的一份內部報告，因為“中國需要優先考慮經濟利益”，避免北京失去最大的貿易戰。 </p><p>到1994年，克林頓總統已將最惠國待遇與中國的人權狀況脫鉤。 1995年，當台灣總統李登輝在康奈爾大學和台灣舉行選舉時，中國於1995年作出強制反應。北京進行了導彈試驗並召回了中國駐美國大使。 </p><p>這些措施，北京希望，將阻止美國和其他國家在未來給予李簽證，中國認為這是支持台灣在法律上獨立的道路。 </p><p>有鑑於此，蔡英文總統最近通過夏威夷過境以及與美國高級領導人的會晤可能是中國反應的一個因素。除非官方邀請台灣總統訪問美國，否則中國對這些過境的強制可能會集中在台灣。中國的目標很可能是阻止台灣領導人在未來通過美國過境或與美國高級官員會面。 </p><p>中國和台灣長期以來關係緊張。但隨著中國經濟影響力的增強，北京開始威脅對美國向台灣出售武器的經濟和外交制裁。從長遠來看，如果中國成功實現出口市場多元化並減少對美中貿易的依賴，北京可能會變得更具強制性 - 特別是對台灣而言。 </p><p> Ketian Vivian Zhang是斯坦福大學Shorenstein亞太研究中心的博士後研究員。她將於2019年夏天加入喬治梅森大學政策與政府學院，擔任國際安全助理教授。 </p>'),(214,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/10/she-went-hospital-an-infection-doctors-found-four-bees-living-her-eye-eating-her-tears/','She went to the hospital for an infection.

While looking at He’s eyes through a microscope, Hung Chi-ting, the hospital’s head of ophthalmology, witnessed something he hadn’t seen before.</p><p>Insect legs were wiggling from one of her eye sockets.</p><p>He yanked out a small bee, known as Halictidae, or a “sweat bee.” And it was alive.</p><p>The doctor wasn’t done.

And a third.</p><p>And, finally, a fourth bee was pulled from the woman’s eyelid.</p><p>Craving salt, the bees had been feeding off He’s tears, the doctor said at a news conference last week, later describing the odd medical diagnosis as a “world first.” The insects had made a new home under He’s eyelid — that is, until they were all removed alive.</p><p>“I saw something that looked like insect legs, so I pulled them out under a microscope slowly, and one at a time without damaging their bodies,” Hung said, according to Business Insider Singapore.</p><p>So how did sweat bees end up camping out in a woman’s eye? He suspects it all started the previous day. As He recounted in the news conference, she was taking part in the Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day.</p><p>“I was visiting and tidying a relative’s grave with my family,\" He recently told reporters. “I was squatting down and pulling out weeds.”</p><p>As CTS News reported, He said she felt something get in her eye. Thinking it was only dirt, she cleaned her eye out with water and did not rub her eyes much for the rest of the day. She didn’t think much of it until her eyes began to swell up that night and she experienced a stinging pain that made her tear up.</p><p>It would have been very likely for sweat bees to be around He at the time, Hung told reporters, as they tend to nest near graves and in the mountains.</p><p>At the hospital the following day, when Hung discovered that the sweat bees were feasting on He’s tears, the doctor was relieved that the woman, who wore contacts, had not rubbed her eyes excessively when the pain worsened, Hung told the BBC. If she had, it could have worsened her inflamed cornea or potentially led to blindness, Apple Daily Taiwan and other media outlets reported.</p><p>Matan Shelomi, an associate professor of entomology at National Taiwan University, told The Washington Post that he had never heard of sweat bees infesting a person before the recent incident.</p><p>“To my knowledge, this is the first case of a bee or a wasp getting caught in a part of a person’s anatomy, as far as I know,” he said. “I’m sure the sweat bees got by the eye and got squished between the eye and eyelid. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</p><p>In addition to needing pollen and nectar like other bees, Shelomi said, sweat bees, which are dark-colored and metallic, will occasionally need salt to supplement their diet. A study this month from the Kansas Entomological Society found that sweat bees also look to tears as a protein source.</p><p>“They don’t seem to be bothered by people, so they will go to any source of salt,\" Shelomi said. \"I think they’re kind of dumb if they come to humans for their salt. They haven’t figured out what we are.”</p><p>While there are more than 1,000 species of sweat bees in the United States, Canada and Central America, according to Terminix, they are almost painless and sting only when they are provoked. On the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, a scale of relative agony caused by sawflies, wasps, bees and ants, the sweat bee comes in at the lowest level of pain. Described by the index as “light, ephemeral, almost fruity,” the puny sting is compared to “a tiny spark [that] has singed a single hair on your arm.”</p><p>“She couldn’t have asked for a better bee to sting her in her eye,” Shelomi said.</p><p>He was discharged and is expected to make a full recovery, KRON-TV reported. The bees are still alive, Hung told the BBC, and will now be studied.</p><p>“This is the first time in Taiwan we’ve seen something like this,” the doctor said.</p><p>Even though the case is probably the most unusual he’s heard about in his time studying entomology, Shelomi emphasized that what happened at the gravesite in Taiwan was a fascinating but not worrisome “freak occurrence.”</p><p>“The woman will be fine. The bees will be fine,” Shelomi stressed. “This is not something that people need to concern themselves with.

','In his speech, Xi reiterated Beijing’s long-standing policy toward Taiwan, with “national unification” as the objective and “One Country, Two Systems” as the model.','Zhiqun Zhu','1547678767000',1547678767000,'<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping made a high-profile speech regarding Taiwan on Jan. 2 to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1979 “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan.” That 1979 speech was the Chinese government’s first policy overture to Taiwan, which replaced “liberation of Taiwan” with “peaceful unification” as the goal. Xi’s speech marking the occasion has generated heated debates about Taiwan-China relations.</p><p>Based on Taiwan’s official reactions so far, one can expect a stormy relationship between the two sides in the next couple of years — a battle that is sure to become part of the current tensions between the United States and China.</p><p>Right after World War II, the Chinese civil war resumed between Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces and Mao Zedong’s communist guerrillas. Chiang was defeated and moved his Republic of China government to Taiwan, while Mao declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China on the mainland in 1949. The two sides remained bitter enemies and had no official contact during much of the Cold War. Relations gradually improved since the 1980s as Taiwan lifted martial law and the mainland started to open up.</p><p>Over the years, a distinct Taiwanese identity has grown while the Chinese identity has declined in Taiwan. Since Taiwan became a multiparty democracy, cross-strait relations have become more complicated. But when Ma Ying-jeou was in power in Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, Taiwan-China relations were stable and friendly, and cross-strait exchanges were dynamic.</p><p>That changed with the election of the Democratic Progressive Party’s Tsai Ing-wen as president of the Republic of China in 2016, and the relationship between Beijing and Taiwan has been characterized by stalemate over the past few years. From Beijing’s perspective, 2019 was a fitting time to send a new message — and a new warning — to Taiwan. A man with a sense of historical mission, Xi has been seriously eyeing Taiwan as part of his “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation. As he stated confidently in his speech, Taiwan must and will be united with the motherland.</p><p>In his speech, Xi reiterated Beijing’s long-standing policy toward Taiwan, with “national unification” as the objective and “One Country, Two Systems” as the model. In this sense, Xi’s speech is a continuation of previous official statements, which focused on Beijing’s intent for peaceful reunification and cross-strait exchanges while reserving the right to use force, if necessary.</p><p>But Xi’s speech also contained something new. First, he introduced more flexibility to the “One Country, Two Systems” model proposed for Taiwan. That’s important, because China operates under a “One Country, Two Systems” model elsewhere, in its relationship with Hong Kong and Macao. Xi is undoubtedly aware of the grim reality in Hong Kong, where frustration is growing over how Beijing has rapidly undermined the city’s political institutions, democratic activism and media freedom.</p><p>Not wanting to replicate that situation with Taiwan, Xi is making a significant policy adjustment. In contrast to the Hong Kong case, where the “One Country, Two Systems” model was imposed in 1997 without input from the Hong Kong people, what Xi is suggesting is involving the Taiwanese in developing a new model for Taiwan. The move injects a level of self-determination for Taiwan into the unification model.</p><p>Xi also proposed that representatives from different parties and walks of life in Taiwan should join Beijing in political consultations to discuss cross-strait relations and make political arrangements for Taiwan’s future. This might be the most intriguing and innovative part of his speech since it essentially kicks off the unification process by sidestepping the unpopular governing party. He did not set a timetable for unification, but this proposal, if implemented, would represent a giant stride toward Beijing’s goal of unification with specific steps being taken to prepare for the future.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the Tsai administration immediately and categorically rejected Xi’s proposal without much deliberation. Were the Tsai administration open to discussions, or willing to offer a plan to improve cross-strait relations, Taiwan could use its vibrant democracy as a tool to shape the future of the Chinese mainland. Beijing says anything can be discussed under “one China”; Taiwan certainly can and should raise its preconditions for unification. That would put tremendous pressure on the mainland to move toward democratization.</p><p>Tsai’s position toward the mainland hardened last year. Now she only uses “China” to refer to the mainland instead of the more conciliatory “Chinese mainland” that she used during her first year in office. In Taiwan, when politicians refer to the mainland as “China”, it’s a clear indication of their anti-China and pro-independence position. </p><p>Tsai’s shift toward a more hard-line approach has many possible causes: loss of five diplomatic allies of the ROC during her term so far; perceived “bullying” by Beijing in international arenas; her strategy to play the China card to deflect internal discontent toward her lackluster performance; and her party’s loss in local elections last year.</p><p>Though Xi has offered more flexibility in the unification process, it is clear that Beijing’s “wait and see” attitude toward Tsai is over. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office has for the first time publicly lashed out at Tsai as a “separatist.” It’s almost certain that Tsai will become more hard-line before the 2020 Taiwan elections as she struggles to be reelected. Her leadership has been disappointing to most Taiwanese, including her supporters. To be tough on China and brand herself as a leader to defend Taiwan’s sovereignty may help her win back some votes.</p><p>Xi’s firm determination and Tsai’s strong resistance suggest that the Taiwan Strait will not be calm in the next couple of years. That has real implications for the United States. Tsai will strive to strengthen relations with the United States while maintaining an anti-China stance. And there is reason to believe Washington will be amenable to her overtures. President Trump signed several pro-Taiwan bills into law in 2018, including the Taiwan Travel Act and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, moves that Beijing resents.</p><p>The U.S. government will likely continue to play the Taiwan card when dealing with China, but Taiwan’s people must be cautious and sober. It is not inconceivable that someday Trump may decide to sell out Taiwan in order to strike a deal with China. Taiwan’s future is inextricably linked to China’s.

In his first full season as professional sports team owner, Dundon’s Carolina Hurricanes are back in the NHL playoffs, snapping the league’s longest dry spell and drawing the spotlight to the on-ice party in one of the league’s smallest markets.</p><p>“Given where the franchise has been, just this step of getting to the playoffs and not having to talk any more, not think any more about what used to be,” Dundon said in an interview this week. “We can now be pretty focused on what we want the Hurricanes to be going forward.”</p><p>Depending on one’s viewpoint, the Hurricanes are either the feel-good story of the NHL season or an affront to hockey’s tradition of stoic celebration. And their 47-year-old owner in his first full season is either a disrupter who bought an organization in need of disruption or the leader of a “bunch of jerks.” And it’s just possible that all those things are sort of true.</p><p>“Listen, there was some shaking that needed to be done,” NBC analyst Mike Milbury said. “… Whatever the formula was that was used down there, it’s shaken out a pretty good team, a team that’s made the playoffs for the first time in forever.”</p><p>But Dundon’s soaring Q rating in the sports world is largely due to his association with the Alliance of American Football, a minor league operation that had garnered attention for its heady ambitions and quick demise. As his Hurricanes take the ice against the Washington Capitals in the opening round this week, Dundon is still picking up the pieces from his short-lived, high-priced foray into professional football.</p><p>[As Capitals prepare Stanley Cup defense, Todd Reirden\'s son faces an ongoing battle]</p><p>In January he swooped in as a savior, pledging $250 million to rescue a league that was struggling to pay its bills. But less than seven weeks later, Dundon decided to pull the plug eight games into the AAF’s inaugural season, cutting his losses — estimated at $70 million — and dooming a start-up just as it was getting started.</p><p>Although rumors had been swirling, the swift ax caught many by surprise. Team and league officials were given no advance warning, and the handling of the situation has been roundly criticized. Players, coaches and team employees stopped drawing a salary immediately. Many were left stranded in cities without housing and forced to pay for flights home. Those who were injured were suddenly on the hook for necessary medical expenses.</p><p>“My thing is, I don’t know who the dude is — Tom Dundon, whatever his name is — you could have at least finished out the season, these last two games,” said Taiwan Jones, a former Michigan State player who signed with the AAF team in Memphis barely 24 hours before the league folded. “…You took that away. You could have folded this at the end of the season.”</p><p>Dundon declined to answer questions this week about the football league, citing ongoing legal issues that need to be worked out. Last week, the league put out an unsigned statement, saying: “We understand the difficulty that this decision has caused for many people and for that we are very sorry. This is not the way we wanted it to end, but we are also committed to working on solutions for all outstanding issues to the best of our ability.”</p><p>[This linebacker broke his arm playing in the AAF. Three days later the league folded.]</p><p>A maverick making calculated risks</p><p>The recent hockey turnaround and the football flop are among the most high-profile business dealings of Dundon’s wildly successful career. He has a net worth that has been estimated around $1 billion, built largely from working in financial services and auto lending after a failed foray into the food industry. His financial firm is based in Dallas, where he attended Southern Methodist University. His splashy venture into the sports world has garnered attention and made headlines, but his approach shouldn’t surprise anyone who followed his career marked by bold ideas, calculated decisions and big results.</p><p>“I try to measure every risk,” he said, speaking generally about business philosophy and his hockey franchise. “I don’t think we do anything that’s not measured. … I’m not a risk-taker. I’m not going to jump out of an airplane with a parachute.”</p><p>In NHL circles, Dundon has quickly established himself as a maverick of sorts, an owner who didn’t need to sit in the background or rely on an old playbook. He purchased controlling interest of the franchise for $420 million, taking over in January 2018. The franchise was floundering, struggling in the standings and in the stands.</p><p>Thirteen years had passed since Carolina’s Stanley Cup championship and 10 since its previous postseason appearance. It was time for change, even if some were uneasy about what that might mean.</p><p>“The truth is, we have a small group of very passionate fans. The job was to grow that number,” Dundon said. “So there wasn’t a lot of risk when you\'re on the lower end. We only had upside.”</p><p>After just a couple of months of ownership, Dundon demoted general manager Ron Francis, perhaps the franchise’s greatest player and wildly popular with fans. He was later fired, though his jersey still hangs from the rafters at PNC Arena. The coach, Bill Peters, resigned after the season. Dundon eventually gave his interim GM Don Waddell the job permanently and promoted assistant coach Rod Brind’Amour, who was a captain on Carolina’s championship team, to head coach.</p><p>[Capitals\' title defense will begin against red-hot, scrappy Hurricanes]</p><p>He was disruptive, challenging his staff to rethink the way it did things and scrutinize costs. Nothing was sacred, and not everything was popular. Radio play-by-play announcer Chuck Kaiton had covered the franchise since its inaugural season in 1979, moving from Hartford, Conn., to Raleigh and never missing a game. He was reportedly offered an 80 percent pay cut last spring, which was essentially an invitation to leave.</p><p>“He sees things differently and doesn’t get emotional about his decisions” is how a friend, Charlotte Jones Anderson, a Dallas Cowboys executive vice president, once explained Dundon to the Dallas Morning News.</p><p>In Dundon’s other businesses, his track record lent credibility to his new ideas. “The difference here is you come in and you want to do something different — people start off thinking, ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about because you’re not a hockey person or you haven’t been in the sports business,’\" he said. \" … I wouldn’t want to overstate that as being difficult, just that it’s different.”</p><p>Presiding over ‘a bunch of jerks’</p><p>Dundon liked what he was seeing on the roster and behind the scenes. The team drafted Andrei Svechnikov with the second pick, signed free agent goaltender Petr Mrazek to a team-friendly one-year, $1.5 million deal and acquired winger Micheal Ferland and defenseman Dougie Hamilton in a trade with Calgary. The team later named Justin Williams its captain and would see 21-year-old Sebastian Aho continue to blossom into a dominant first-line center.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Perhaps the most visible change came following home wins this season, when the Hurricanes received considerable attention for their elaborately choreographed postgame celebrations. Players did a limbo line under a hockey stick and played duck-duck-goose on the ice. Williams used his helmet as a bowling ball, knocking down teammates lined up like pins, and a pair of players fished from the bench, reeling in a teammate flopping on the ice.</p><p>“All those little celebrations somehow managed to be a cohesive thing for them, despite getting some pretty strong criticism from up north,” Milbury said.</p><p>Old-school purists with ice in their veins weren’t amused. Canadian analyst Don Cherry called the Hurricanes “a bunch of jerks.” Rather than kowtow to traditionalists, the team responded by printing T-shirts that read “A bunch of jerks.” They sold several thousand, and the team had an identity.</p><p>“I think it’s been great,” Dundon told ESPN. “I’m glad [Cherry’s] talking about us. People don’t always talk about the Hurricanes, so I hope he keeps talking about us.”</p><p>While some bristled when the team opted to wear Hartford Whalers jerseys for a pair of games, many more started taking notice of what the Hurricanes were doing. Attendance increased more than 15 percent on the season, and according to a team official, new season ticket sales are up 260 percent from this time a year ago.</p><p>“He is a very smart guy, and he applied what worked for him in his other businesses to Carolina,” Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks’ owner, said in an email. “It’s obviously worked for him.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs feels different than other business success, he said, in part because it’s a shared accomplishment and the culmination of months and months of work. “I wasn’t looking to be vindicated,” he said. “I just wanted the organization to take this step because things tend to be easier when you’re talking about the future versus the past. We don’t have to talk about the past any more.”</p><p>But people continue to talk about his role in ending the AAF midseason, even as Dundon maintains his silence on the matter.</p><p>“He was in a bad spot but it also seems like he doesn’t care,” Jones said. \"He didn’t come out and make a [personal] statement or nothing because it doesn’t affect him — which it doesn’t. You have money.”</p><p>Dundon knows for now people are talking about him and his loud entrance into the sports world. That wasn’t his goal, but at least they’re talking, he figures, particularly about the future of the Hurricanes.</p><p>“When I bought the team, I realized the Carolina Hurricanes weren’t a topic of conversation in the world, and they have to be,” Dundon said. “Long-term, it needs to be about our players and our coaching. But short-term, I felt like I had to help. I think you’ll find over time that I’ll move into the shadows. The more the team is the story, the better.”</p><p>Tramel Raggs contributed to this report.</p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c1_vUGKQtmJyPIlibd9pkUL7CUw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W5ESUYBULII6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg','[\"402\", \"3\", \"4\"]',1,'Tom Dundon的兩個觀點：Carolina Hurricanes的救世主和AAF禍害','一位相對不為人知的德州商人正在以大膽的舉動製作頭條新聞，這些舉動產生了不同的結','在他作為職業體育隊老闆的第一個完整賽季中，Dundon的卡羅來納州颶風隊重新回到了NHL季后賽，擊敗了聯盟最長的干戰，並成為聯盟最小市場之一的冰上派對的焦點。','<p> Tom Dundon能夠在沒有名望的情況下建立自己的財富，遠遠不是聚光燈下的成功，似乎有了所有的答案，即使沒有真正的公開質疑。 </p><p> “我從未接受任何採訪，也從未想過任何關注，”Dundon說。 </p><p>現在沒有避免它。突然間，有很多東西要談 - 甚至更多，他說他不能談論。在他作為職業體育隊老闆的第一個完整賽季中，Dundon的卡羅來納州颶風隊重新回到了NHL季后賽，擊敗了聯盟最長的干戰，並成為聯盟最小市場之一的冰上派對的焦點。 </p><p> Dundon本週接受采訪時表示，“考慮到球隊在哪裡，只是邁向季后賽的這一步，不再需要再談，不再考慮過去的情況了。” “我們現在可以非常專注於我們希望颶風向前發展的目標。” </p><p>根據一個人的觀點，颶風要么是NHL季節的感覺良好的故事，要么是對曲棍球的堅忍慶祝傳統的侮辱。他們47歲的老闆在他的第一個完整賽季就是一個破壞者，他買了一個需要破壞的組織，或者是一群“混蛋”的領導者。而且所有這些事情都可能是真的。 </p><p> NBC分析師邁克米爾伯里說：“聽著，還有一些需要做的事情。” “......無論在那裡使用什麼配方，都會讓一支非常出色的球隊，一支永遠第一次進入季后賽的球隊震撼。” </p><p>但Dundon在體育界的Q評分飆升主要是因為他與美國足球聯盟（Alliance of American Football）的關係，這是一項由於其雄心壯志和快速消亡而引起關注的小聯盟運動。由於他的颶風在本週的首輪比賽中對陣華盛頓首都隊，所以Dundon仍然從他短暫的高價進軍職業足球中撿到了一些東西。 </p><p> [隨著首都隊準備斯坦利杯的防守，托德·里爾登的兒子將面臨持續的戰鬥] </p><p> 1月份，他作為一名救世主突然出現，承諾投入2.5億美元來拯救一個正在努力支付賬單的聯盟。但不到七個星期之後，Dundon決定將八場比賽拉到AAF的首個賽季，減少他的損失 - 估計為7000萬美元 - 並且在開始時就開始了。 </p><p>雖然謠言一直在旋轉，但迅速的斧頭讓很多人感到驚訝。球隊和聯盟官員沒有得到預先警告，對局勢的處理受到了嚴厲的批評。球員，教練和球隊員工立即停止領薪。許多人被困在沒有住房的城市，並被迫支付回家的航班費用。那些受傷的人突然陷入必要的醫療費用。 </p><p> “我的事情是，我不知道這個傢伙是誰 - 湯姆頓頓，無論他的名字是什麼 - 你可以至少完成本賽季，這最後兩場比賽，”前密歇根州立大學球員台灣瓊斯簽名在聯盟倒閉前不到24小時，在孟菲斯的AAF隊。 “......你把它帶走了。你可以在賽季結束時棄牌。“ </p><p> Dundon拒絕回答本周有關足球聯賽的問題，並引用了需要解決的持續法律問題。上週，聯盟發表了一份未簽名的聲明，稱：“我們理解這一決定給很多人帶來的困難，我們非常抱歉。這不是我們希望它結束的方式，但我們也致力於盡最大努力為所有懸而未決的問題制定解決方案。“ </p><p> [這名線衛在AAF打破了他的手臂。三天后聯賽倒閉了。 </p><p>特立獨行者制定計算風險</p><p>最近的曲棍球轉身和足球失敗是Dundon成功事業中最引人注目的商業交易之一。他的淨資產估計約為10億美元，主要來自於在進入食品行業後未能從事金融服務和汽車貸款業務。他的金融公司位於達拉斯，在那裡他就讀於南衛理公會大學。他在體育界的熱情投入引起了人們的關注並成為頭條新聞，但他的方法不應該讓那些追隨他的職業生涯的人感到驚訝，他們以大膽的想法，有計劃的決定和重大成果為標誌。 </p><p> “我試圖衡量每一個風險，”他說，一般性地談到商業哲學和他的曲棍球特許經營權。 “我不認為我們做任何沒有衡量的事情。 ......我不是風險承擔者。我不打算用降落傘跳出飛機。“ </p><p>在NHL圈子裡，Dundon很快就成了一個特立獨行的人，一個不需要坐在後台或依賴舊劇本的老闆。他以4.2億美元的價格購買了該特許經營權的控股權，並於2018年1月接管。該特許經營權正在掙扎，在積分榜上和看台上掙扎。 </p><p>卡羅來納州斯坦利杯冠軍賽已經過去了十三年，自上一次季后賽出場以來已經過了十年。現在是變革的時候了，即使有些人對這可能意味著什麼感到不安。 </p><p> “事實是，我們有一小群非常熱情的粉絲。 Dundon說，工作就是增加這個數字。 “因此，當你處於低端時，沒有太大的風險。我們只有上漲空間。“ </p><p>在經歷了幾個月的所有權之後，Dundon降級了總經理Ron Francis，也許是球隊最偉大的球員，並且非常受球迷歡迎。他後來被解雇了，雖然他的球衣仍懸掛在PNC競技場的椽子上。教練比爾彼得斯在賽季結束後辭職。 Dundon最終給了他的臨時總經理Don Waddell永久的工作，並將助理教練Rod Brind&#39;Amour提升為主教練，他是卡羅萊納州冠軍隊的隊長。 </p><p> [首都的頭銜防禦將開始對抗熾熱，鬥志旺盛的颶風] </p><p>他是破壞性的，挑戰他的員工重新思考它做事的方式並仔細審查成本。沒有什麼是神聖的，並不是一切都很受歡迎。電台播放播音員Chuck Kaiton自1979年首次開賽以來，已經覆蓋了球隊，從康涅狄格州哈特福德轉會到羅利，從未錯過比賽。據報導，他去年春天減薪80％，這基本上是一次請假。 </p><p> “他以不同的方式看事情並且對他的決定沒有感情用事”，達拉斯牛仔隊執行副總裁夏洛特瓊斯安德森曾經向達拉斯晨報解釋了鄧頓。 </p><p>在Dundon的其他業務中，他的業績記錄為他的新想法提供了可靠性。 “這裡的不同之處在於你進來了，你想要做一些不同的事情 - 人們開始思考，&#39;你不知道你在談論什麼，因為你不是一個曲棍球的人，或者你沒有參加體育運動“他說。”......我不想誇大其認為困難，只是因為它不同。“ </p><p>主持&#39;一堆混蛋&#39; </p><p> Dundon喜歡他在名單和幕後所看到的內容。球隊在第二順位選中了Andrei Svechnikov，簽下了自由球員守門員Petr Mrazek，與球隊進行了一年150萬美元的交易，並在與卡爾加里的交易中收購了邊鋒Micheal Ferland和防守隊員Dougie Hamilton。該隊隨後將賈斯汀·威廉姆斯命名為隊長，並將看到21歲的塞巴斯蒂安·阿霍繼續成為占主導地位的一線中鋒。 </p><p></p><p></p><p>也許最明顯的變化發生在本賽季主場胜利之後，當時颶風因精心編排的賽后慶祝活動而備受矚目。球員在曲棍球棒下做了一條曲線，並在冰上打鴨鴨鵝。威廉姆斯把他的頭盔當作一個保齡球，擊倒了像針腳一樣排成隊的隊友，還有一對球員從板凳上撈起來，在隊友的冰面上掙扎。 </p><p>米爾伯里說：“所有那些小小的慶祝活動都成功地為他們做了一個有凝聚力的事情，儘管從北方得到了一些非常強烈的批評。” </p><p>他們的血管中帶有冰的老派純粹主義者並沒有被逗樂。加拿大分析家Don Cherry稱颶風是“一堆混蛋。”該團隊不是向傳統主義者叩頭，而是打印出印有“一堆混蛋”的T卹。他們賣了幾千件，團隊有了自己的身份。 </p><p> “我認為這很棒，”Dundon告訴ESPN。 “我很高興[櫻桃]談論我們。人們並不總是談論颶風，所以我希望他一直在談論我們。“ </p><p>雖然當球隊選擇佩戴哈特福德捕鯨隊的球衣進行一對比賽時有些人感到憤怒，但還有更多球員開始關注颶風的影響。本賽季的出席人數增加了15％以上，據一位球隊官員稱，新賽季的門票銷售額比去年同期增長了260％。 </p><p>達拉斯小牛隊的老闆馬克庫班在一封電子郵件中說：“他是一個非常聰明的傢伙，他將其他業務中適用的東西應用到卡羅來納州。” “這顯然對他有用。” </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>他說，達到斯坦利杯季后賽的感覺與其他商業成功不同，部分原因在於這是一項共同的成就，也是數月和數月工作的結晶。 “我不想被證明是正確的，”他說。 “我只是希望組織採取這一步驟，因為當你談論未來與過去時，事情往往會更容易。我們不必再談論過去了。“ </p><p>但人們繼續談論他在結束AAF賽季中的作用，即使Dundon對此事保持沉默。 </p><p>瓊斯說：“他處境不利，但似乎他也不在乎。” “他沒有出來做個人陳述，也沒有做任何事情，因為它不影響他 - 但事實並非如此。你有錢。” </p><p> Dundon現在知道人們正在談論他和他大聲進入體育界。這不是他的目標，但至少他們正在談論，他認為，特別是關於颶風的未來。 </p><p> “當我收購球隊時，我意識到卡羅萊納颶風不是世界上的話題，而且必須是，”Dundon說。 “從長遠來看，它需要關注我們的球員和我們的教練。但短期來說，我覺得我必須要幫忙。我想你會隨著時間的推移發現我會進入陰影中。團隊的故事越多越好。“ </p><p> Tramel Raggs對本報告做出了貢獻。 </p>'),(217,9,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-might-china-want-to-steal-these-silicon-secrets/2019/04/11/55ebbdf4-5c56-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html','Why Might China Want to Steal These Silicon Secrets?','ASML’s technology will be crucial for making the next generation of chips.

A U.S. court made XTAL pay $230 million in damages to ASML last year, but its links to the Chinese state weren’t clear at the time. </p><p>ASML doesn’t enjoy the name recognition of an Apple Inc., Intel Corp. or Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., but it is Europe’s second-biggest technology company by market capitalization. The world’s chipmakers buy its machines in order to manufacture the semiconductors that go into our smartphones, computers, cars and servers. ASML’s biggest customers are Intel and Samsung, as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which makes iPhone chips for Apple.</p><p>The Dutch company has one serious advantage over rivals Nikon Corp. and Canon Inc. – it’s the only firm to have mastered next-generation extreme ultraviolet lithography. Lithography is the process by which circuit patterns are etched onto silicon wafers. The EUV process will allow the printing of circuits that are more than 10 times smaller than the current standard.</p><p>The EUV machines cost more than 100 million euros ($113 million) apiece, and are starting to be delivered. The innovation could put off the day that Moore’s Law, which says that processing power doubles every 18 months, no longer holds true.</p><p>That’s why the firm’s technology would be particularly attractive to China. The country aims to spend some $150 billion over a decade to assume a leading role in technology design and manufacturing as part of its “Made in China 2025” push. Although it is a hub for electronics manufacturing, assembling iPhones, laptops, smart speakers and more, a lot of the crucial underlying technology is imported, including some $200 billion of annual semiconductor imports. China accounted for 17 percent of ASML’s 11 billion euros in sales last year.</p><p>This production push got a lift from the U.S. Commerce Department’s move last year to ban Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp. from buying American-made components. Though the embargo attempt fell through, the threat such a prohibition would have posed to domestic output is a lesson that has been learned. If China wants to have a standalone semiconductor industry, then it also needs to gain proficiency in the equipment needed to make the chips. One reason it can’t just buy this is that there’s a limit to how many EUV machines ASML can produce: it expects to ship just 30 such systems in 2019, up from 18 last year. The same goes for other lithography equipment.</p><p>Click here for a QuickTake on China’s technology push</p><p>It’s unclear what important technology, if any, was stolen by XTAL, whose parent Dongfang Jingyuan has “indirect links” to China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, according to the FD.

Depending on how broadly “material support” is interpreted, the designation may complicate U.S. diplomatic and military cooperation with certain third-country officials, notably in Iraq and Lebanon, who deal with the Guard.</p><p>President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the step with great fanfare last week, opening a one-week consultation period with Congress during which members could have raised objections.</p><p>Lawmakers were broadly supportive, but congressional Iran hawks are now expressing concern that the administration may extend waivers on oil and nuclear sanctions. Those sanctions, which are unrelated to the Guard designation, were imposed last November following Trump’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that May.</p><p>They target major elements of Iran’s economy, notably its energy sector, by hitting foreign companies and governments with so-called “secondary sanctions” if they continue to do business with targeted Iranian entities. A main goal has been to dry up revenue from Iran’s oil exports, which the U.S. says is the main driver of the country’s funding of destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>In order not to shock oil markets with the sudden loss of Iranian crude, the administration granted several waivers that allowed some nations and Taiwan to continue their imports as long as they moved to reduce them to zero. Those waivers are due to expire in early May, and Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere are urging the administration not to renew any of them. They say extending even some of the eight waivers would run counter to Trump and Pompeo’s stated goal of keeping “maximum pressure” on Iran.</p><p>U.S. officials have been coy when asked about the waivers, leading to concern among hawks that some or all of them may be extended.</p><p>The administration’s point man for Iran, Brian Hook, has said that three of the waivers won’t need to be extended as those countries have eliminated all Iranian oil imports. But he has remained silent on the other five. Pompeo has similarly refused to comment on the possibility of extensions.</p><p>In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Pompeo was pressed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about whether the oil sanctions waivers, as well as waivers related to technical cooperation at Iranian nuclear facilities, would be extended. He suggested that some at the State Department were pushing for extensions.</p><p>“Let me urge you and urge the department unequivocally not to grant the nuclear waivers and not to grant the oil waivers,” Cruz said, “I think maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure.”</p><p>Pompeo demurred, but during a trip to South America over the weekend he bristled when asked if the Iran hawks had reason to be concerned.</p><p>“It’s ludicrous,” he told reporters accompanying him. “It’s ludicrous. Look, people want to tell stories, people want to sell newspapers. I’ve got it. Congressmen will grandstand, I’ve got that too. The State Department’s going to get it right. We understand our mission.”</p><p>Cruz was not impressed.</p><p>“The Senate Foreign Relations Committee needs to understand why some in the State Department think it’s a good idea to keep enriching the Ayatollah with oil billions and to let Iran keep spinning centrifuges in a bunker that they dug into the side of a mountain so they could build nuclear weapons,” he said in a statement released by his office.</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Each uses an average 12 bottles.</p><p>The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric.

So now, unilaterally, the Trump administration declared that the US would no longer allow China, Japan, South Korea and five other countries to buy any oil from Iran.</p><p>Within minutes after the move became known, oil prices began to spike—a boon for Russia, one of the world\'s largest oil suppliers. But not so good for a whole lot of other countries—including American motorists who\'ll be paying a lot more for gasoline this summer. China, a nation whose leaders Trump is courting hard for his much-needed trade pact, did not react well to his oil edict. </p><p>With oil exports comprising some 60% of Russia\'s total merchandise exports and 30% of its GDP, every dollar increase in the price of oil translates immediately into a dramatic improvement in Russia\'s financial position. This cannot help but offset some of the impact of the sanctions that the United States and Western Europe continue to level on Russia as a result of the Kremlin\'s seizure of Crimea and its ongoing activities in Eastern Ukraine.</p><p>In hard dollar terms, the impact is even more apparent. With Russia producing some 11 million barrels of oil a day, each dollar increase in the price per barrel of crude oil adds at least $4 billion to the Russian economy each year . Moreover, Russia ran a budget surplus last year that was close to 3% of its GDP, higher than forecast, as Russia\'s Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin told the Financial Times in December. It was the first such annual budget surplus since 2011. </p><p> </p><p>As it happens, oil prices are one of the few economic indicators that are effectively a zero-sum game. While the oil price increases already anticipated by today\'s American action may boost Russia\'s economy, they also add substantially to the burden on America\'s allies in Western Europe, who consume some 13 million barrels of oil per day. </p><p> </p><p>Moreover, there are other real threats to the Europe\'s oil supplies, particularly from the ongoing unrest in Libya, just across the Mediterranean, which had been pumping some 1.2 million barrels a day before the latest unrest, much of it destined for Europe.   There are fears that unrest could lead to cutbacks of as much as half that output, further raising oil prices—and again providing another healthy boost to the Russian economy.  </p><p> </p><p>At least Russia and China, a leading victim of Monday\'s Trump embargo action, have been preparing for this day for years. In January 2018, the second Russia-China oil pipeline came online,  boosting Russia\'s capacity to satisfy rapidly expanding Chinese oil requirements—and more cheaply than with a long sea voyage in expensive super-tankers from Iran to the nearest Chinese oil port.</p><p>But beyond all these short-term effects of Monday\'s decision to screw down the hold on Iran even tighter are other black swan impacts that can still be seen on the horizon. These include the ability of large multi-national companies, especially in the oil patch, to forecast accurately the supply-demand-price equations that figure deeply into their decisions to invest or their pricing of products that require large amounts of petroleum. Not to mention any sudden increase in gas prices at the pump as Americans head out for their summer holidays.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, of course, there are any number of geopolitical implications of the United States again dictating the trajectory of the world oil market and the broader economics that are so deeply dependent on this path.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All these are issues that the President should have considered before embarking on this course and that may be far more difficult to undo than to implement.</p><p></p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/cnn/1556093197780','[\"229\", \"230\", \"255\"]',0,'特朗普伊朗石油抵制的大贏家：弗拉基米爾普京',NULL,'雖然今天美國行動已經預期的油價上漲可能會刺激俄羅斯的經濟，但它們也大大增加了美國在西歐的盟友的負擔，他們每天消耗約1300萬桶石油。','<p> The RedLines Project的執行董事David A.

In another they don traditional outfits and stand next to an ox plowing a paddy field. \"Do you all have a farm such as this?\" the caption asks.</p><p>Their short videos are a small part of a massive nationwide attempt to lift all of China\'s 1.4 billion people out of poverty by 2020 -- a goal which President Xi Jinping set in a speech in 2015.</p><p>The Chinese government defines poverty as earning less than $416 (2,800 yuan) a year or around $1.10 a day -- a lower benchmark than the World Bank poverty line of $1.90 a day, or just under $700 a year.</p><p>Beijing has dispatched about 775,000 party officials to drive the anti-poverty campaign. Many are going door-to-door to work out what the government can do to help. Those who fail in their missions to alleviate poverty could face career oblivion, according to state media.   </p><p>The idea to stream videos of the village came from Gaibao\'s chief poverty alleviation official, Wu Yusheng, and has helped the town, in the province of Guizhou, sell its organic produce online. </p><p>Residents also receive virtual gifts from fans via the app, which they can exchange for cash.  </p><p>Wu, who arrived in the village in 2018, said he had already achieved his goal -- but it is unclear whether Xi will do the same. </p><p>At worst, some experts fear the ruling Communist Party might just announce poverty has been eradicated, regardless of the reality, to avoid embarrassing Xi.  </p><p>\"Local leaders are taking it extremely seriously, almost in a panicky way. Part of the problem is that they don\'t know really what to do, so they\'re kind of grasping at different solutions,\" said John Donaldson, a poverty expert and associate professor at Singapore Management University. \"They\'re throwing everything at it.\"</p><p>The campaign against poverty</p><p>The dream of eradicating widespread poverty in China didn\'t begin with Xi. It dates back to the Communist Party\'s rise to power in 1949. \"The reason for the existence of the Chinese Communist Party in the beginning is because of injustice and poverty among farmers,\" Donaldson said. </p><p>Chairman Mao Zedong\'s economic experiments, however, actually set the country back, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London. </p><p>\"In 1949, Shanghai was still a richer city than Hong Kong. In 1949, any coastal province was richer and more developed than Taiwan. In 1979, Hong Kong and Taiwan were way, way ahead,\" Tsang said.</p><p>Mao\'s disastrous Great Leap Forward, beginning in 1958, was ostensibly an attempt to transform a mainly agrarian society through industrialization and collectivization. Instead, it helped create a famine that cost tens of millions of lives and aggravated poverty across the country.</p><p>Things began to change after Mao\'s death. In 1978, then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing China\'s economy and one of his first reforms was to let struggling farmers sell excess produce to make a profit.</p><p>China\'s efforts to combat poverty since then have been staggering. In 1990, there were more than 750 million people living in poverty across the nation, according to the World Bank -- over 60% of the population. Almost 30 years later in 2019, Beijing says that number has dropped to just 16.6 million.</p><p>One of the Communist Party\'s main claims to power in recent years has been that it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.  </p><p>Perhaps for that reason, Xi still isn\'t satisfied. Despite the growing wealth of China\'s major cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, parts of rural China live without electricity, fresh water and adequate food or clothing.</p><p>In his 2015 speech, Xi said he was inspired to make poverty a priority by his experience working in the countryside in the 1960s when his father, a prominent party official, fell from favor during Mao\'s Cultural Revolution. </p><p>\"I toiled with the villagers at the time, with the aim to make life a bit better, but it was harder than reaching the sky in that year,\" he said.   </p><p>Roads, internet and jobs</p><p>The government\'s plan is broadly divided into two strategies -- big national policies and small local interventions.</p><p>At a national level, the policies revolve around infrastructure spending. Xi\'s administration is pouring billions of dollars into the problem, $19 billion in 2019 alone, which has been spent on a variety of projects and initiatives across the country.</p><p>More than 200,000 kilometers (124,274 miles) of roads were built or renovated in 2018 and 94% of poor villages were connected to the internet, according to government figures. </p><p>Dozens of state-owned enterprises have joined the campaign and poured more than $4 billion (30 billion yuan) into poverty relief programs as of early 2019, according to state media.</p><p>Some of these big-ticket projects have sparked controversy. A number of provincial governments have been accused of trying to simply move millions of poor people to newly built urban accommodation to raise them out of poverty.</p><p>Some older rural citizens have refused to go, while others have moved but then returned to their old homes. Maggie Lau, a professor at Hong Kong\'s Lingnan University, said such schemes aren\'t always pragmatic. \"If they move to a higher-cost area, how can they afford those new living costs?\" she asks.</p><p>But to a large degree, the anti-poverty campaign is small-scale and has been left in the hands of local officials.</p><p>\"Every local official on a township level (one above a village) goes down to every poor household and tries to find out what\'s going on and why people are poor and how to apply resources to that,\" Donaldson said, describing his observations in Chinese villages. </p><p>The solutions proposed vary wildly but often focus on encouraging villagers to lift themselves out of poverty by developing local industries, engaging in e-commerce and boosting rural tourism.</p><p>While Donaldson said the effort expended was \"amazing,\" problems emerged with government officials spending too much time just knocking on doors talking about poverty rather than tackling local problems. \"The danger is that it will be a confused mess,\" he said.</p><p>There has also been a lack of patience with poor villagers who fail to get with the program.</p><p>In a report in February, Wu Weihua, a vice chairman of the national legislature, complained that some people just don\'t want to \"get rich.\"</p><p>\"Some poor people even have the mindset of, \'You don\'t help, I don\'t move\',\" the report said.</p><p>Corruption and pollution</p><p>Failure is not tolerated -- and the government is watching where its money is being spent.</p><p>In March 2018, a provincial governor was kicked out of the Communist Party, partly for his failure to address poverty in his jurisdiction. In October that year, inspections were carried out in provinces across central and western China to check that officials were following orders on poverty alleviation. </p><p>The flood of government and company funds allocated to deal with the issue has also revived the ever-present threat of corruption. More than 170,000 individuals were disciplined in 2018 alone for misappropriation of poverty alleviation funds, according to the party\'s anti-graft agency Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. </p><p>There have also been signs that the government\'s laser-like focus on poverty is impeding another of its main goals -- environmental conservation.</p><p>A 2015 research paper found evidence that work by the government to eradicate poverty by boosting the economy was lowering air and water quality in affected regions.</p><p>Heavily polluting industries were encouraged to set up shop, bringing jobs and prosperity at the expense of the environment.

</p><p>貴州村扶貧負責人吳說，他“絕對有信心”可以實現2020年的目標。 </p><p> “政府正在盡一切努力實現這一目標。而在微觀層面上，貧困人口的目標確實非常精確。如果整個社會都在努力，這不是問題，”他說。 </p><p>但專家和國際觀察家表示，中國的貧困目標達到了最低限度 - 城市和農村將需要做更多的工作，以確保每個人都享有高質量的生活。 </p><p>哥倫比亞大學中國社會政策中心主任秦高在2018年的一份報告中表示，政府對醫療保健和就業的支持比個人基金或電子商務措施更有用。 </p><p> “只有有效的發展措施和社會政策與服務相結合，才能幫助中國長期消除農村貧困，”她說。 </p><p>但唐納森表示，即使目標在2020年實現，他也不相信政府會放棄貧困作為一個問題。 </p><p>他說：“任何一個負責任的政府都會關注你如何幫助改善那些可能並不貧困但仍在苦苦掙扎的人的生活水平。” “我希望這將成為該黨的永久議程。” </p><p></p>'),(242,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/04/17/terry-gou-the-founder-of-foxconn-is-running-for-president-in-taiwan','Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, is running for president in Taiwan','The country’s richest man wants warmer ties with China','Mr Gou has a good chance to secure the nomination of the KMT, which will pick a candidate based largely on an opinion poll, like the DPP, but also with some input from a vote of the party’s members.','','2019-04-17T00:00:00Z',1555459200000,'<p>AT A TEMPLE festooned with red lanterns, Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, declared that Mazu, the sea goddess, had recently appeared to him in a dream. “Mazu told me to come out and do something,” he recounted after lighting some incense.

His decision to seek the nomination of the Kuomintang party (KMT), Taiwan’s main opposition party, for the presidential election in January, has caused a sensation on the island-state.

Her approval ratings are low. She faces a challenger for the nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the form of her former prime minister, Lai Ching-te. Mr Lai is more popular than Ms Tsai, which is especially troubling for the president since the DPP will pick as its nominee the candidate who performs best in a national opinion poll to be conducted in late May or early June.</p><p>Mr Gou has a good chance to secure the nomination of the KMT, which will pick a candidate based largely on an opinion poll, like the DPP, but also with some input from a vote of the party’s members. The two other declared candidates, Eric Chu, a former mayor of New Taipei City, and Wang Jin-pyng, a former speaker of parliament, are not as famous as Mr Gou. The more formidable Han Kuo-yu, the mayor of Taiwan’s second-biggest city, Kaohsiung, may yet throw his hat in the ring—although he may also be put off by Mr Gou’s unexpected candidacy.</p><p>Either way, Mr Gou will doubtless try to sell himself as an ordinary Taiwanese made good—hence his folksy visit to the temple in the gritty suburbs of Taipei. He founded Foxconn with a small loan, and built it into the world’s biggest contract manufacturer for big electronics brands. Given that voters are concerned above all with the weakness of the Taiwanese economy, his business acumen will be a big selling point.</p><p>But in another sense, Mr Gou’s business empire will be a liability. Most of Foxconn’s factories are in China. That gives the Chinese government huge leverage over him. It is hard to see how Mr Gou can escape from the glaring conflict of interest.</p><p>Lots of Taiwanese own businesses in China, and around 1m of them work there, out of a total population of 24m. The KMT favours warmer ties with China, and still upholds the idea that the two countries will one day be reunified. The DPP, in contrast, considers Taiwan a completely distinct country, and would like the world to treat it as such.</p><p>Since the DPP won both the presidency and a majority in parliament in 2016, China has called a halt to all high-level contacts between the two countries and choked off the flow of Chinese package tourists to Taiwan. It has also tried to win over the few countries that still have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and regularly deploys warships and fighter jets dangerously close to the island.</p><p>Mr Gou could probably put a stop to this intimidation with a more emollient approach were he to become president.

One other defendant, Tanya Chan, had her sentencing postponed because of the need to undergo surgery.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if they planned to appeal.</p><p>\"Thank you for the sentencing,\" Raphael Wong, given eight months, told Judge Johnny Chan. \"Our determination on fighting for genuine universal suffrage will not change.\"</p><p>While the charges carried potential sentences of up to seven years, they were still seen as unusually harsh by activists in what they called an attempt to intimidate them into silence.</p><p>\"The long sentences send a chilling warning to all that there will be serious consequences for advocating for democracy,\" said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based chief researcher for China at Human Rights Watch.</p><p>\"The Beijing and Hong Kong authorities appear intent on eliminating the only pocket of freedoms on Chinese soil,\" Wang said. She cited a law against booing the Chinese national anthem and moves to amend the extradition law that could see suspects sent to China where they\'d be unlikely to receive a fair trial.</p><p>Supporters and family members applauded the defendants as they entered the courtroom, then stood outside sobbing after the hearing before breaking into chants.</p><p>Those convicted included law professor Benny Tai, retired sociology professor Chan Kin-man and pastor Chu Yiu-ming, who all received 16 months though Chu\'s was suspended for two years. The others include two current and one former lawmaker, two student leaders and a political activist.</p><p>Chan, who will be sentenced June 10, said prior to the hearing that she hadn\'t lost faith in what the movement stood for. \"Although it\'s an uphill battle, it\'s not easy, it\'s time for us to make sure that we are strong enough to face different kind of challenges,\" Chan said.</p><p>The nine were leaders of the \"Occupy Central\" campaign, which was organized as a nonviolent sit-in that became known as the \"Umbrella Movement\" after a symbol of defiance against police adopted by the street protests.</p><p>Protesters demanded the right to freely nominate candidates for Hong Kong\'s leader who would then be elected by all of the territory\'s roughly 5 million voters. However, they failed to win any concessions from the government, and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was chosen in 2017 from among a slate of candidates approved by Beijing and elected by a 1,200- member pro-China electoral body.</p><p>Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement in which China promised the city could retain its own laws, economic system and civil rights for 50 years.</p><p>However, Chinese President and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has been seen as extending his crackdown on civil liberties to Hong Kong, drawing criticism from commercial and legal associations as well as political, human rights and media groups.</p><p>\"In the verdict, the judge commented we are naive, believing that by having a occupy movement we can attain democracy. But what is more naive than believing in one country two systems?\" Chan Kin-man said before the sentences were issued.</p><p>In Taiwan\'s capital Taipei, youthful supporters rallied to denounce the convictions and growing pressure from Beijing on both their self-ruled island and Hong Kong.</p><p>China has demanded Taiwan agree to its claim to the island as Chinese territory, to be annexed by force if necessary, and accept a \"one country, two systems,\" framework for governing along the lines of that in place in Hong Kong.</p><p>\"Occupy Central is not a crime,\" they chanted, as well as the \"The Hong Kong government is unjustified.\"</p><p>\"The fact that you care about Hong Kong means you care about your own fate. I think this is very important,\" Tien-chi Martin-Liao, a member of Independent Chinese PEN Center, said in an address following the sentencing hearing.</p><p>\"Your support will be felt in the hearts of those persecuted in Hong Kong, and those who live there,\" he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press video journalist Wu Taijing in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/washingtonpost/1556278424394','[\"276\", \"355\", \"256\"]',63,'香港親民主抗議活動的領導人被判刑',NULL,'中國要求台灣同意將其作為中國領土的主張，必要時以武力吞併，並接受“一國兩制”的治理框架，與香港的一致。','<p>香港 - 香港一家法院於週三向八名領導人舉行了長達16個月的監禁判決，其中涉及公共滋擾罪的2014年大規模抗議活動。 </p><p>這句話被視為中國半自治領土政府在北京的壓力下在抗議活動中劃清界線的努力。 </p><p>九名被告的年齡從30多歲到70多歲不等，他們跨越了幾代一直鼓動全民主的香港公民。被告人都表示無罪，稱這些起訴具有政治動機。 </p><p>三名抗議領導人獲得了16個月，其中一人被停職兩年，兩人被判入獄八個月，另外兩人被判緩刑八個月。另一位被命令執行200小時的社區服務。另一名被告Tanya Chan由於需要接受手術而推遲了她的判刑。 </p><p>目前還不清楚他們是否打算上訴。 </p><p> “感謝你的判決，”Raphael Wong在八個月後告訴法官Johnny Chan。 “我們爭取真正普選的決心不會改變。” </p><p>雖然這些指控可能被判處長達7年的刑期，但他們仍然認為他們所謂的企圖恐嚇他們陷入沉默，他們仍然非常苛刻。 </p><p>人權觀察中國駐香港首席研究員Maya Wang說：“長句會向所有人發出令人不寒而栗的警告，即宣揚民主會產生嚴重後果。” </p><p> “北京和香港當局似乎有意消除中國土地上唯一的自由，”王說。她引用了一項禁止起訴中國國歌的法律，並提出修改引渡法的措施，該法可能會將嫌犯送到中國，在那裡他們不太可能接受公平審判。 </p><p>支持者和家人在進入法庭時為被告喝彩，然後在聽證會之後站在外面抽泣，然後闖入吟唱。 </p><p>那些被定罪的人包括法學教授Benny Tai，退休社會學教授Chan Kin-man和牧師Chu Yiu-ming，他們都獲得了16個月，但Chu被停職兩年。其他人包括兩名現任和一名前立法者，兩名學生領袖和一名政治活動家。 </p><p>陳將於6月10日被判刑，在聽證會之前說，她並沒有對這一運動所代表的內容失去信心。 “雖然這是一場艱苦的戰鬥，但這並不容易，現在是我們確保自己足夠強大以應對不同挑戰的時候了，”陳說。 </p><p>這九人是“佔領中央”運動的領導人，該運動被組織成一個非暴力的靜坐，在街頭抗議活動所採取的反對警察的象徵之後被稱為“傘運動”。 </p><p>抗議者要求自由提名香港領導人候選人的權利，然後由全境約500萬選民當選。然而，他們未能贏得政府的任何讓步，香港行政長官林嘉欣於2017年從北京批准的候選人名單中選出，並由1200名親中選舉機構選舉產生。 </p><p>香港是一個前英國殖民地，1997年根據一項協議移交給中國統治，中國承諾該市可以保留自己的法律，經濟制度和民權50年。 </p><p>然而，中國總統和共產黨領導人習近平被視為將對公民自由的鎮壓擴大到香港，受到商業和法律協會以及政治，人權和媒體團體的批評。 </p><p> “在判決中，法官評論說我們很天真，他們相信通過佔領運動我們可以實現民主。但是，相信一個國家的兩個制度更天真？”陳健文在判決發表之前說。 </p><p>在台灣首都台北，年輕的支持者團結起來，譴責北京在自治島和香港的定罪和不斷增加的壓力。 </p><p>中國要求台灣同意將其作為中國領土的主張，必要時以武力吞併，並接受“一國兩制”的治理框架，與香港的一致。 </p><p> “佔領中環不是犯罪”，他們高呼，“香港政府沒有道理”。 </p><p> “你關心香港這個事實意味著你關心自己的命運。我認為這非常重要，”中國獨立筆會中心成員田天琪在量刑聽證會上的講話中說。 </p><p>他說：“你們的支持將會在那些在香港遭受迫害的人和那些住在那裡的人心中感受到。” </p><p> ___ </p><p>台灣台北的美聯社視頻記者吳太京為本報告做出了貢獻。 </p>'),(249,7,'https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/23/us/politics/23reuters-usa-election-2020-candidates-factbox.html?searchResultPosition=6','Factbox: Big Democratic Field Taking Shape for 2020 U.S. Presidential Race',NULL,'He first gained national attention when he unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership.',' Reuters','2019-04-23',1555977600000,'<p>WASHINGTON — The largest Democratic field in the modern U.S. political era is lining up to seek the party\'s 2020 presidential nomination - and it is expected to keep growing.</p><p>The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators. A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them becomes the party\'s nominee.</p><p>Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average for those who register in opinion surveys. </p><p>JOE BIDEN</p><p>The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet. But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race. At 76, he would be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic nominating contests, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden would be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. Liberal activists criticize his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his \"Middle-Class Joe\" nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden, recently the subject of allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, in a video pledged to be \"more mindful\" of respecting \"personal space,\" an attempt to tamp down the controversy.</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS</p><p>The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.</p><p>BETO O’ROURKE</p><p>The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping on to store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O\'Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O\'Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party\'s nominating battle, O\'Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors. </p><p>KAMALA HARRIS </p><p>The first-term senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party. </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN</p><p>The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.\"</p><p>CORY BOOKER</p><p>Booker, 49, a senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Booker, who is black, has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.</p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR</p><p>The third-term senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar\'s campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists. </p><p>JULIAN CASTRO</p><p>The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party\'s presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother was immigrated to Texas from Mexico, has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump\'s border policies. Castro advocates for a universal pre-kindergarten program, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas.</p><p>ANDREW YANG</p><p>The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York. </p><p>KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and she pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brew pub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver.</p><p>JAY INSLEE </p><p>The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012. </p><p>JOHN DELANEY</p><p>The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He’s also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation. </p><p>TULSI GABBARD </p><p>The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign. </p><p>ERIC SWALWELL</p><p>The third-term congressman from a California district south of San Francisco cited tackling student debt and gun violence among the reasons he jumped into the Democratic primary race. Swalwell, 38, is among the younger candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He served on the House Intelligence Committee and founded the Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change. </p><p>TIM RYAN</p><p>The moderate nine-term congressman from a working-class district in the battleground state of Ohio has touted his appeal to the blue-collar voters who fled to Trump in 2016. He says Trump has turned his back on those voters and failed to live up his promise to revitalize the manufacturing industry. Ryan, 45, pledges to create jobs in new technologies and to focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare. He first gained national attention when he unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership. A former college football player, he also has written books on meditation and healthy eating.</p><p>SETH MOULTON</p><p>An Iraq War veteran and member of Congress, Seth Moulton, 40, was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014 when he defeated a fellow Democrat in the primary election. Moulton served in the Marines from 2001 to 2008. He became a vocal critic of the Iraq War in which he served, saying no more troops should be deployed to the country. He has advocated stricter gun laws, saying military-style weapons should not be owned by civilians. Moulton supports the legalization of marijuana and told Boston public radio station WGBH in 2016 that he had smoked pot while in college. After Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018, Moulton helped organize opposition to Representative Nancy Pelosi\'s bid to again become speaker. </p><p>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON</p><p>The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled Williamson to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.</p><p>WAYNE MESSAM</p><p>Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of in the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University\'s 1993 national championship football team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/washingtonpost/1556278423888','[\"126\", \"309\",

</p><p> BERNIE SANDERS </p><p>來自佛蒙特州的參議員在2016年失去了民主黨提名，希拉里克林頓，但已經跳了第二次嘗試。在2020年的比賽中，77歲的桑德斯將不得不在一個充滿活力的進步領域中脫穎而出，兜售四年前他帶入民主黨主流的問題。他的建議包括公立大學的免費學費，15美元的最低工資和全民醫療保健。他受益於強大的知名度和強大的小額捐贈者網絡，幫助他在比賽的第一天籌集了590萬美元。桑德斯的父親是來自波蘭的猶太移民，他在這次競選活動中表現出了更為個人化的一面，突顯了他在一個工人階級家庭中長大的掙扎。在2016年贏得少數民族選民的困難之後，他還試圖接觸黑人和西班牙裔領導人。 </p><p> BETO O&#39;ROURKE </p><p>這位前任三屆德克薩斯州國會議員於3月14日參加了比賽，並且自從向早期主要州的選民傳達樂觀信息以來，他一直專注於存儲檯面。 46歲的奧羅克去年因其創紀錄的籌款活動而名聲大噪，並且在美國參議院對共和黨現任特德克魯茲的比賽中出人意料地微弱輸掉之前吸引了大批人。奧羅克宣佈在他的競選活動的前24小時內籌集了610萬美元的籌款資金，最好的是他的民主黨對手。但隨著黨內提名戰爭的前沿政策和多元化的進步，奧羅克將面臨一個挑戰，作為一個富有的白人，他在幾個關鍵問題上比他的許多競爭對手更溫和。 </p><p>卡瑪拉哈里斯</p><p>來自加利福尼亞州的第一任參議員將成為歷史上第一位獲得提名的黑人女性。現年54歲的哈里斯是來自牙買加和印度的移民的女兒，她宣布參加紀念被殺害的民權領袖馬丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）的候選人。她對民主黨的競選產生了迅速的影響，這種競選將受到女性和少數民族選民的嚴重影響。她在競選活動的前24小時內籌集了150萬美元，並在CNN電視轉播的市政廳中獲得了創紀錄的收視率。她支持中產階級稅收抵免，Medicare for All醫療保健基金改革，綠色新政和大麻合法化。她作為舊金山地區檢察官和加利福尼亞州總檢察長的記錄已經在民主黨中受到審查，民主黨近年來在刑事司法問題上發生了變化。 </p><p> PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>這位37歲的印第安納州南本德市市長正在逐漸擺脫弱勢地位，因為他開始與年輕選民建立勢頭。他是哈佛大學的畢業生和牛津大學的羅德學者，他講七種語言，並在美國海軍預備隊服役於阿富汗。他吹噓自己是代表打擊特朗普所需的新一代領導者。 Buttigieg將成為美國一個重要政黨的第一位公開同性戀總統候選人。 </p><p> ELIZABETH WARREN </p><p>來自馬薩諸塞州的這位69歲的參議員是該黨自由黨的領導人，也是一位凶悍的華爾街評論家，他在創建消費者金融保護局方面發揮了重要作用。她把她的總統競選活動集中在她的民粹主義經濟信息上，承諾打擊她所謂的有利於富人的操縱經濟體系。她還提議取消選舉團，誓言如果當選，就會分拆亞馬遜，谷歌和Facebook，並宣誓政治籌款活動為她的出價收集現金。沃倫今年早些時候向切羅基國家道歉，因為她進行了DNA測試以證明她對美洲原住民血統的主張，這一說法促使特朗普嘲笑她稱她為“風中奇緣”。 </p><p> CORY BOOKER </p><p>現年49歲的布克是來自新澤西州和紐瓦克市前市長的參議員，他在爭奪布雷特卡瓦諾的最高法院提名方面取得了全國性的突出地位。布克是一名黑人，他將美國的種族關係和種族差異作為其競選活動的焦點，並指出歧視對其家庭的影響。他為每一位美國人，綠色新政和其他關鍵問題接受醫療保險報導的進步立場，並吹噓他對攻擊的積極性。布克吃了純素飲食，最近證實了他正在約會女演員羅薩里奧道森的謠言。 </p><p> AMY KLOBUCHAR </p><p>來自明尼蘇達州的第三任參議員是民主黨爭奪特朗普的第一位溫和派。 58歲的Klobuchar在參議院聽證會期間與Brett Kavanaugh爭吵時獲得全國關注，因為他在最高法院提名時獲得了提名。在競選活動中，前檢察官和公司律師支持替代傳統的醫療保險醫療保險基金，並對處方藥價格上漲採取強硬態度。 Klobuchar的活動報告稱其頭48小時內籌集了超過100萬美元。她的宣傳活動發布之際，有消息稱，參議院辦公室的工作人員被要求做瑣事，因此難以招聘高級別的競選戰略家。 </p><p>朱利安卡斯特羅</p><p>美國總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）領導的住房和城市發展部長將成為第一位贏得美國主要總統候選人提名的西班牙裔美國人。現年44歲的卡斯特羅的祖母從墨西哥移民到德克薩斯州，他利用家人的個人故事來批評特朗普的邊境政策。卡斯特羅倡導普及的幼兒園前計劃，支持全民醫保，並引用他的經驗來推動經濟適用房。他在他的家鄉聖安東尼奧宣布了他的出價，曾在那裡擔任過市長和市議員。他的孿生兄弟Joaquin Castro是來自德克薩斯州的民主黨國會議員。 </p><p>安德魯楊</p><p>這位企業家和前技術主管將他的競選活動重點放在雄心勃勃的全球收入計劃上。 44歲的楊希望保證所有年齡在18到64歲之間的美國公民每個月可以獲得1000美元的支票。作為來自台灣的移民的兒子，楊也在推動人人享有醫療保險，並提出一種“以人為本”的新形式的資本主義。他住在紐約。 </p><p> KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>吉利布蘭德（Gillibrand）在擔任紐約州北部的女議員時被稱為溫和派，她已經將自己變成了一個堅定的進步者，呼籲制定嚴格的槍支法並支持綠色新政。現年52歲的紐約州參議員已經領導了解決軍隊和大學校園性侵犯的問題，並敦促國會改善自己對性行為不端指控的處理。在競選活動中，她對特朗普發表了激烈的譴責。她發布了2007年到2018年的納稅申報表，提供了迄今為止最全面的2020年白宮候選人財務狀況，並呼籲她的競爭對手也這樣做。 </p><p> JOHN HICKENLOOPER

Military Titan',NULL,'In the opening scenes of the \"Strong Military\" documentary, Xi is shown boarding the guided missile destroyer Haikou at Shekou port on December 8, 2012, and sailing into the South China Sea for the first time since becoming party and military chief that year.',' Reuters','2019-04-23',1555977600000,'<p>HONG KONG — In 1938, in the midst of a long campaign to bring China under Communist Party rule, revolutionary leader Mao Zedong wrote: \"Whoever has an army has power.\"</p><p>Xi Jinping, Mao\'s latest successor, has taken that dictum to heart.</p><p>He has donned camouflage fatigues, installed himself as commander-in-chief and taken control of the two million-strong Chinese military, the People\'s Liberation Army. It is the biggest overhaul of the PLA since Mao led it to victory in the nation\'s civil war and founded the People\'s Republic in 1949.</p><p>Xi has accelerated the PLA\'s shift to naval power from a traditionally land-based force. He has broken up its vast, Maoist-era military bureaucracy. A new chain of command leads directly to Xi as chairman of the Central Military Commission, China\'s top military decision-making body. Operational leadership of naval, missile, air, ground and cyber forces has been separated from administration and training - a structure that Chinese and Western defense analysts say borrows from U.S. military organization.</p><p>(See the interactive version: https://reut.rs/2Uzr9z4)</p><p>The Chinese leader isn\'t just revolutionizing the PLA. Xi is making a series of moves that are transforming both China and the global order. He has abandoned reform architect Deng Xiaoping\'s injunction that China should hide its strength and bide its time. The waiting game is over. Xi\'s speeches are peppered with references to his \"Chinese dream,\" where an ancient nation recovers from the humiliation of foreign invasion and retakes its rightful place as the dominant power in Asia.</p><p>The effort includes signature shows of soft power: Xi\'s multibillion-dollar \"Belt and Road\" program to build a global trade and infrastructure network with China at its center, and his \"Made in China 2025\" plan to turn the country into a high-tech manufacturing giant.</p><p>But the boldest stroke is his expansion of China\'s hard power, through his remaking of the PLA, the world\'s largest fighting force. At the core of this vision of national renewal is a loyal, corruption-free military that Xi demands must be prepared to fight and win.</p><p>His push to project power abroad was accompanied by a power play at home. Xi has purged more than 100 generals accused of corruption or disloyalty, according to the official state-controlled media.</p><p>A raw demonstration of his authority came when state television broadcast a laudatory documentary series about the PLA, \"Strong Military.\" In one scene in the 2017 series, an elderly man sits in a military court at a desk marked \"defendant,\" looking frail in a navy-blue civilian jacket. It is Guo Boxiong, a former general and the most senior officer convicted in Xi\'s purge. He reads his confession to charges of bribery from a sheaf of papers gripped in both hands.</p><p>\"The Central Military Commission dealt with my case completely correctly,\" says Guo, who had once served as vice-chairman of the body. \"I must confess my guilt and take responsibility for it.\" Guo was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>In a series of stories, Reuters is exploring how the rapid and disruptive advance of Chinese hard power on Xi Jinping\'s watch has ended the era of unquestioned U.S. supremacy in Asia. In just over two decades, China has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the U.S. armory. China\'s shipyards have spawned the world\'s biggest navy, which now rules the waves in East Asia. Beijing can now launch nuclear-armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines, giving it a powerful second-strike capability. And the PLA is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the South China Sea, while stepping up preparations to recover Taiwan, by force if necessary.</p><p>\'THE U.S. COULD LOSE\'</p><p>For the first time since Portuguese traders reached the Chinese coast five centuries ago, China has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast. Conflict between China and the United States in these waters would be destructive and bloody, particularly a clash over Taiwan, according to serving and retired senior American officers. And despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the Cold War, there would be no guarantee America would prevail.</p><p>\"The U.S. could lose,\" said Gary Roughead, co-chair of a bipartisan review of the Trump administration\'s defense strategy published in November. \"We really are at a significant inflection point in history.\"</p><p>Roughead is no armchair theorist: A retired admiral, as former Chief of Naval Operations he held the top job in the U.S. Navy until 2011. His alarm reflects a growing view across the American defense establishment. In their report, he and his colleagues issued a dire warning. The United States faces a \"national security crisis,\" principally arising from growing Chinese and Russian military power. \"U.S. military superiority is no longer assured and the implications for American interests and American security are severe,\" the panel concluded.</p><p>It is clear that Xi wants to bring the era of U.S. dominance in Asia to an end. \"In the final analysis, it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia and uphold the security of Asia,\" he said in a 2014 speech to foreign leaders on regional security.</p><p>China\'s Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions for this article or detailed summaries of its findings.</p><p>This account of Xi and the PLA - which despite the \"army\" in its name comprises all military branches - is based on interviews with 17 current and former military officers from China, the United States, Taiwan and Australia. Many would only speak on condition of anonymity. It draws on the accounts of Chinese officials and people with ties to the senior leadership in Beijing who have known Xi Jinping and his family for decades and are familiar with his career as he rose through the party and government bureaucracy. It also relies on Chinese government publications describing Xi\'s political thinking, his speeches and official documentaries showcasing his leadership of the military.</p><p>In Washington, the world\'s pre-eminent military power is mobilizing to respond. After decades of seeking engagement in the expectation that Beijing would become a cooperative partner in world affairs, the United States is treating China as a strategic competitor bent on displacing it as Asia\'s dominant force.</p><p>Largely in reaction to this challenge, Washington is boosting defense spending, rebuilding its navy and urgently developing new weapons, particularly longer range conventional missiles. It is expanding military ties with other regional powers, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Singapore and India. And it\'s conducting an international diplomatic and intelligence campaign to counter China\'s cyber-attacks, traditional espionage and intellectual property theft. This campaign includes efforts to contain the global reach of Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp.</p><p>The confrontation comes as the administration of President Donald Trump is waging a tariff war aimed at reducing China\'s massive trade surplus with the United States. However the trade conflict is resolved, a graver risk is the possibility that the deeper tensions could boil over into an armed clash between Beijing and Washington and its allies in the hotly contested maritime zones off the Chinese coast.</p><p>UNEXPECTED RISE</p><p>The rise of the PLA is not all Xi\'s doing. Long before he took power, the military had been transformed from the massive but rudimentary land force that swept Mao and his comrades, including Xi\'s father, to victory over the Nationalists in 1949. Decades of steep increases in defense spending paid for an arsenal of high technology weapons; millions of soldiers were demobilized. But corruption became endemic.</p><p>Xi\'s two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, were civilians who took office without a network of support among PLA brass. They fostered loyalty through patronage, pay rises and budget increases, according to Chinese and Taiwanese analysts and retired officers. Under the weak leadership of Hu in particular, they say, senior officers exploited their positions to siphon off money, particularly from the logistic and equipment budgets. Rank buying became rampant.</p><p>The military hierarchy Xi inherited had become a law unto itself under Hu, according to Li Nan, a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore. \"It was out of control, in a sense,\" said Li. \"Now the power is centralized in the hands of Xi Jinping.\"</p><p>Xi, a so-called princeling, grew up as a member of China\'s Communist Party aristocracy, even though his family suffered separation and persecution in Mao\'s chaotic Cultural Revolution. His late father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary military leader who became a top government official in the early years of Communist rule. He was later purged in Mao\'s upheavals, before emerging a key leader of China\'s market reforms in the 1980s.</p><p>Xi\'s dramatic accumulation of power was unexpected. He took a low profile as he slowly worked his way up the Communist Party and state bureaucracy, according to multiple Chinese familiar with his early career.</p><p>His first job out of university in 1979 was serving in a junior post as a uniformed aide to General Geng Biao, then minister of defense. Xi\'s official biography records this three-year posting as \"active duty.\" In this role, he had access to classified military documents, including files on the 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam, according to sources with ties to the leadership. He had to memorize hundreds of telephone numbers and was not allowed to rely on a telephone book, in case it was lost or stolen, they said.</p><p>He then began a series of provincial government and party postings. In these roles, his performance was relatively unremarkable. As governor of the southeastern Province of Fujian, for instance, he was obsessed with the bureaucratic routine of political study sessions where officials review Communist Party documents and speeches of senior leaders, according to people who knew him at the time.</p><p>And he was far from universally popular. He finished last in elections for alternate members of the party\'s 200-strong Central Committee during the 15th Communist Party Congress in 1997.</p><p>This nondescript record appears to have worked in his favor. During his period as China\'s paramount leader, President Jiang Zemin handpicked Xi for senior office because the younger man was perceived to lack ambition, according to sources with close ties to the Chinese leadership. Xi was also thought to be a pliable candidate because he lacked a power base, one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>But as China\'s top leader, he has shown a willingness to impose radical change at the top of the party, government and military.</p><p>\"When I talk to my mainland friends, they all say he is a risk taker,\" said Andrew Yang Nien-Dzu, former defense minister of Taiwan. \"You never know what his next move will be.\"</p><p>XI THE SOLDIER</p><p>From the beginning, Xi\'s corruption purge and promotion of loyal officers made it clear he had big plans for the PLA. Then, in mid-2015, he cut 300,000 mostly non-combat and administrative personnel before launching a sweeping overhaul of the military structure.</p><p>He broke up the four sprawling, Maoist-era \"general departments\" of the PLA that had become powerful, highly autonomous and deeply corrupt, said Li from the National University of Singapore. Xi replaced them with 15 new agencies that report directly to the Central Military Commission he chairs.</p><p>He also scrapped the seven geographically based military regions and replaced them with five joint-service theater commands. These new regional commands, comparable to those that govern the U.S. armed forces, are responsible for military operations and have a strong focus on combining air, land, naval and other capabilities of the Chinese armed forces to suit modern warfare.</p><p>Xi also promoted favored commanders, many of them officers he knew in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, where he served the bulk of his early career as an official, according to Chinese and Western observers of the PLA. Others hail from his home province of Shaanxi or are fellow princelings.</p><p>At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi further tightened his grip over the top military leadership, paring the Central Military Commission from 11 members to seven and stacking it with loyalists. Xi knew most of them from Shaanxi and Fujian.</p><p>As he burnishes his military credentials, Xi draws on his early service in uniform. In speeches to military audiences, he describes himself as a soldier-turned-official, according to reports in the state-controlled media. In distinctive PLA camouflage fatigues, cap and combat boots, he has overseen some of the biggest military parades since the 1949 Communist victory. In the most recent of these displays, Xi has taken the salute from the troops without sharing the podium with the usual line-up of fellow party leaders and elders.</p><p>In a massive naval exercise in April last year, Xi boarded the guided-missile destroyer Changsha to review the Chinese fleet of 48 warships in the South China Sea. State-run television showed the navy commander, Vice Admiral Shen Jinlong, and navy political commissar, Vice Admiral Qin Shengxiang, standing to attention as they reported to Xi and saluted. Xi then gave the order for the exercise to proceed.</p><p>Both navy chiefs are Xi protégés. Shen has been rapidly promoted under Xi, leapfrogging other, more senior officers, according to Chinese and Western analysts. Qin had worked closely with the Chinese leader in a top post in the Central Military Commission before his promotion in 2017 to his navy role, China\'s official military media reported.</p><p>Xi was also in fatigues again in July 2017 at a massive military parade to mark the 90th anniversary of the PLA at the Zhurihe training ground in Inner Mongolia. He took the salute from the parade commander, General Han Weiguo, an officer who served in Fujian while Xi was a party and government official in the province. Han has enjoyed a meteoric rise under Xi, being promoted to command China\'s ground forces shortly after this parade.</p><p>\"Xi Jinping is obsessed with military parades,\" said Willy Lam Wo-lap, a veteran observer of personnel movements in China\'s military and political elites and a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \"He loves these demonstrations of raw power.\"</p><p>As part of Xi\'s martial image-building, the party\'s propaganda machine portrays him as the leader responsible for a decisive pivot in China\'s recovery from foreign conquest and colonial domination that began with the First Opium War in the mid-19th Century.</p><p>In the opening scenes of the \"Strong Military\" documentary, Xi is shown boarding the guided missile destroyer Haikou at Shekou port on December 8, 2012, and sailing into the South China Sea for the first time since becoming party and military chief that year. As Xi looks to the horizon through binoculars, the narrator says: \"As the warship pierces the waves, Xi Jinping peers toward a vision obscured in the mist of history when, 170 years ago, Western powers came from the sea to open the door to China, beginning a bitter nightmare for ancient China.\"</p><p>The nightmare ends, according to the documentary, with the Communist victory under Mao and the periods of growing economic and military power under former leaders Deng, Jiang and Hu. With Xi in charge, the series shows, a heavily armed China is poised to recover its former glory.</p><p>PRESSURE ON TAIWAN</p><p>Propaganda aside, Xi is proving far more assertive than his most recent predecessors in employing China\'s new military power. In 2013, China began dredging and island-building in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, an area in which Beijing has competing territorial claims with the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and Brunei.</p><p>Xi personally directed these moves, according to a July 2017 commentary in Study Times, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party\'s Central Party School. \"It is the equivalent of building a Great Wall at sea,\" the commentary said.</p><p>Extensive fortification of these outposts, including missile batteries, means that China has virtually annexed a vast swathe of this ocean. Ahead of his May 30 appointment to head the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson told a Congressional committee that China was now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios \"short of war.\"</p><p>Xi is also stepping up military pressure on Taiwan, Japan and India. Alongside a massive arsenal of missiles capable of striking Taiwan, Chinese naval and air forces conduct increasingly complex exercises that regularly encircle the self-governing island.</p><p>These exercises are designed to intimidate Taiwan and wear down its forces which must respond to these drills, according to some Taiwanese defense analysts. \"They are obviously applying a lot of coercive power over Taiwan,\" said Yang, the former Taiwan defense minister. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is determined to bring it under mainland control.</p><p>In response to questions from Reuters, Taiwan\'s Defense Ministry said it would continue to maintain surveillance and deploy aircraft and warships to \"ensure the safety of our nation\'s air and sea territory.\"</p><p>Chinese naval and air forces are also increasing the tempo of deployments, exercises and patrols through the Japanese island chain. Japan\'s annual military White Paper last year said China\'s \"unilateral escalation\" of activities around Japan was arousing strong security concerns. Japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times in the past year against Chinese aircraft, the government reported this month, up almost 30 percent from the year before.</p><p>\"China has expanded and intensified military activities not only in the East China Sea, but also in the Pacific Ocean and the seas around Japan,\" the Japanese Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. \"These activities appear aimed at improving operational capability and bolstering China\'s presence.\"</p><p>Despite these assertive moves, there are still questions from inside the PLA about the capacity of Chinese forces to compete with the United States and other advanced military powers. In numerous published commentaries, Chinese officers and strategists point to the PLA\'s lack of experience in conflict, technological shortcomings and failure to introduce effective command and control.</p><p>Xi\'s power grab and bold agenda also carry great risk for him personally, the party and China. There has been widespread speculation in China that the corruption crackdown in the military and a parallel purge of party and government officials is at least in part Xi\'s response to a vicious, behind-the-scenes power struggle.</p><p>Rare evidence of this surfaced at a key gathering of top officials. On the sidelines of the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Liu Shiyu, then China\'s chief stock market regulator, accused a group of senior officials deposed in the purge of plotting a coup, including the disgraced former military chief Guo Boxiong. Earlier, the official military newspaper hinted at similar accusations, without citing evidence. Guo, who was imprisoned on corruption charges, could not be reached for comment. The Chinese government has not commented further on this allegation.</p><p>In bringing down so many powerful military and party leaders and their factions, Xi has made many dangerous enemies, say people with ties to the leadership. And steep increases in military spending will become more difficult to sustain if the growth of the debt-burdened Chinese economy continues to slow.</p><p>Still, Xi shows no sign of toning down his drive to galvanize the Chinese military. On October 25, he toured the Southern Theater Command in the city of Guangzhou, the headquarters responsible for the contested South China Sea. State television showed Xi in fatigues and combat boots, striding through the command post with senior brass. Xi, state media reported, told officers to concentrate on \"preparing for war and combat.\"</p><p> (Reporting by David Lague in Hong Kong and Benjamin Kang Lim.

</p><p>中國領導人不僅僅是改革解放軍。習近平正在採取一系列措施，改變中國和全球秩序。他放棄了改革建築師鄧小平的禁令，即中國應該隱瞞自己的力量，並把時間花在一邊。等待遊戲結束了。習近平的演講充斥著他的“中國夢”，一個古老的國家從外國入侵的羞辱中恢復過來，並重新奪回其作為亞洲主導力量的合法地位。 </p><p>這項努力包括軟實力的簽名展示：習近平數十億美元的“一帶一路”計劃，旨在建立以中國為中心的全球貿易和基礎設施網絡，以及他的“中國製造2025”計劃將國家變為高潮科技製造巨頭。 </p><p>但最大膽的一舉是他通過改造世界上最大的戰鬥力量的解放軍來擴大中國的硬實力。這種全國復興願景的核心是一支忠誠，無腐敗的軍隊，習近平要求必須準備好戰鬥和取勝。 </p><p>他在國外投入權力的努力伴隨著家庭的權力遊戲。根據官方媒體控制的媒體報導，習近平已經清除了100多名被控腐敗或不忠的將軍。 </p><p>當國家電視台播放關於解放軍“強軍”的美術紀錄片時，他的權威得到了充分的證明。在2017年系列的一個場景中，一位老人坐在軍事法庭的一張標有“被告”的桌子上，身穿深藍色民用夾克。這是前將軍郭伯雄，也是習近平清洗中被判有罪的最高級官員。他從一堆雙手夾著的文件中讀到了他對賄賂指控的認罪。 </p><p> “中央軍事委員會完全正確處理了我的案件，”曾擔任該機構副主席的郭說。 “我必須承認自己有罪，並對此承擔責任。”郭被判終身監禁。 </p><p>在一系列故事中，路透社正在探索中國硬實力對習近平手錶的快速和破壞性進展如何結束了美國在亞洲無可爭議的霸權時代。在短短二十多年的時間裡，中國已經建立了一支常規導彈部隊，可以與美國軍械庫中的導彈相媲美或超越它們。中國的造船廠催生了世界上最大的海軍，現在它統治了東亞的海浪。北京現在可以從一支彈道導彈潛艇作戰艦隊發射核武器導彈，使其具備強大的二次打擊能力。中國人民解放軍正在南海廣闊的地區加強哨所，並在必要時加強準備以武力恢復台灣。 </p><p> &#39;美國可能會失去&#39; </p><p>五個世紀以來，葡萄牙貿易商首次抵達中國沿海地區，中國擁有統治海岸外海的軍事力量。根據在職和退休的美國高級軍官的說法，中國和美國在這些海域的衝突將具有破壞性和血腥性，尤其是對台灣的衝突。儘管自冷戰結束以來幾十年無與倫比的力量，但不能保證美國會佔上風。 </p><p> “美國可能會失敗，”11月發表的特朗普政府防務戰略的兩黨評論聯合主席加里·拉格黑德說。 “我們確實處於歷史的重要轉折點。” </p><p>魯格黑德不是扶手椅理論家：一位退休的海軍上將，作為前海軍作戰部長，他一直擔任美國海軍的最高職位，直到2011年。他的警報反映了美國國防部門越來越多的觀點。在他們的報告中，他和他的同事發出了可怕的警告。美國面臨“國家安全危機”，主要源於中國和俄羅斯軍事力量的增長。 “美國的軍事優勢不再得到保證，對美國利益和美國安全的影響是嚴重的，”專家組得出結論。 </p><p>很顯然，習近平想要結束美國在亞洲的統治時代。 “歸根結底，亞洲人民應該處理亞洲事務，解決亞洲問題，維護亞洲安全，”他在2014年對外國領導人就地區安全發表講話時說。 </p><p>中國國防部，美國印度太平洋司令部和五角大樓沒有對本文的問題或其調查結果的詳細摘要作出回應。 </p><p>習近平和解放軍的說法 - 儘管其名稱中包含“軍隊”包括所有軍事部門 - 都是基於對來自中國，美國，台灣和澳大利亞的17名現任和前任軍官的採訪。許多人只會在不願透露姓名的情況下發言。它藉鑑了中國官員和與北京高級領導人有聯繫的人的記錄，他們認識了習近平和他的家人幾十年，熟悉他在黨和政府官僚機構中崛起的職業生涯。它還依賴於中國政府出版物描述習近平的政治思想，他的演講和官方紀錄片展示了他對軍隊的領導。 </p><p>在華盛頓，世界上最傑出的軍事力量正在動員起來應對。在數十年尋求參與北京將成為世界事務合作夥伴的期望之後，美國將中國視為一個戰略競爭對手，傾向於取代中國成為亞洲的主導力量。 </p><p>華盛頓在很大程度上應對這一挑戰，正在加大國防開支，重建海軍並緊急開發新型武器，特別是射程更遠的常規導彈。它正在擴大與其他地區大國的軍事關係，包括日本，韓國，台灣，澳大利亞，新加坡和印度。它正在進行一場國際外交和情報活動，以對抗中國的網絡攻擊，傳統的間諜活動和知識產權盜竊。此次活動旨在遏制中國電信公司華為和中興通訊的全球影響力。 </p><p>這場對抗發生之際，唐納德特朗普總統的政府正在發起旨在減少中國與美國巨額貿易順差的關稅戰。然而，貿易衝突得到了解決，更嚴重的風險是，更深層次的緊張局勢可能會蔓延到北京和華盛頓及其盟友之間在中國沿海激烈爭奪海域的武裝衝突。 </p><p>出乎意料的崛起</p><p>解放軍的崛起並非所有習近平都在做。早在他掌權之前，軍隊就已經從大規模但不成熟的陸軍轉變為毛澤東和他的同志，包括習的父親，在1949年戰勝國民黨。數十年的國防開支急劇上升支付了高昂的軍火庫技術武器;數百萬士兵復員。但腐敗成了地方病。 </p><p>習近平的兩位前任江澤民和胡錦濤是平民，他們在沒有解放軍黃銅支援網絡的情況下上任。根據中國和台灣的分析師和退休官員的說法，他們通過贊助，加薪和預算增加來培養忠誠度。他們說，特別是在胡錦濤的弱勢領導下，高級官員利用他們的職位來吸走資金，尤其是物流和設備預算。排名購買變得猖獗。 </p><p>根據新加坡國立大學中國軍隊學者李楠的說法，習近平繼承的軍事等級已成為胡錦濤的一項法律。 “從某種意義上說，它失去了控制，”李說。 “現在權力集中在習近平手中。” </p><p>習近平是一位所謂的太子黨，雖然他的家人在毛澤東的混亂文化大革命中遭受了分裂和迫害，但他還是中國共產黨貴族的一員。他已故的父親習仲勳是一位革命軍事領袖，在共產黨統治初期成為政府高級官員。他後來在毛澤東的動盪中被清除，然後在20世紀80年代成為中國市場改革的關鍵領導者。 </p><p>習的戲劇性積累是意想不到的。據熟悉他早期職業生涯的多名中國人說，他在共產黨和國家官僚機構中慢慢走上前，低調。 </p><p>他1979年大學畢業後的第一份工作就是擔任國防部長耿飚將軍的一名穿制服的助手。習的官方傳記將這三年的帖子記錄為“現役”。根據與領導層有聯繫的消息來源，他可以獲得機密軍事文件，包括1979年中國入侵越南的文件。他們說，他必須記住數百個電話號碼，並且不允許依賴電話簿，以防它丟失或被盜。 </p><p>然後，他開始了一系列省政府和政黨的帖子。在這些角色中，他的表現相對不起眼。例如，作為福建東南部省長，他痴迷於官方審查共產黨文件和高級領導人演講的官僚日常工作，據當時認識他的人說。 </p><p>他遠非普遍受歡迎。他在1997年的第十五屆中國共產黨代表大會期間，在黨內200人中央委員會候補成員的選舉中排名最後。 </p><p>這個不起眼的記錄似乎對他有利。據與中國領導人關係密切的消息人士透露，在擔任中國最高領導人期間，江澤民主席精心挑選習近平擔任高級職務，因為年輕人被認為缺乏野心。據一位不願透露姓名的消息人士稱，習近平也被認為是一個柔韌的候選人，因為他缺乏權力基礎。 </p><p>但作為中國最高領導人，他表現出願意在黨，政府和軍隊的高層實施激進變革。 </p><p> “當我與我的大陸朋友交談時，他們都說他是冒險者，”台灣前國防部長安德魯·楊念祖說。 “你永遠不知道他的下一步行動是什麼。” </p><p>十一士兵</p><p>從一開始，習近平的貪污清洗和忠誠的軍官晉升就明確表明他對解放軍有很大的計劃。然後，在2015年中期，他對大部分非戰鬥和行政人員進行了削減，然後對軍事結構進行了徹底的大修。 </p><p>新加坡國立大學的李說，他解散了已經變得強大，高度自治和腐敗的四個龐大的，毛澤東時代的人民解放軍“一般部門”。習近平取代了15個新機構，直接向中央軍委主持會議。 </p><p>他還取消了七個地理位置的軍事區域，取而代之的是五個聯合軍事指揮部。這些新的地區指揮部與美國武裝部隊相比，負責軍事行動，並且非常注重將空中，陸地，海軍和中國武裝部隊的其他能力結合起來，以適應現代戰爭。 </p><p>據中國人民解放軍和中國人民解放軍觀察員說，習近平還提升了青睞的指揮官，其中許多是他在福建和浙江省所知道的軍官，他在那裡擔任官員的早期職務。其他人來自他的家鄉陝西省或太子黨。 </p><p>在2017年10月的第19屆黨代表大會上，習近平進一步加強了對最高軍事領導層的控制，將中央軍事委員會從11名成員削減到7名，並將其與忠誠者一起堆放。習近平知道他們大部分來自陝西和福建。 </p><p>在他的軍事證書上，習近平利用他早期的製服服務。根據國家控制媒體的報導，在向軍事觀眾的演講中，他將自己描述為士兵變身的官員。在獨特的PLA迷彩服，帽子和戰鬥靴中，他監督了自1949年共產黨勝利以來的一些最大的軍事遊行。在最近的這些展覽中，習近平向部隊致敬，而沒有與黨內領導人和長老的常規陣容分享領獎台。 </p><p>在去年4月的一次大規模海軍演習中，習近平登上長沙導彈驅逐艦，審查了中國南海48艘戰艦的艦隊。國營電視節目顯示，海軍司令員，沉金龍中將和海軍政委，海軍中將秦勝祥在向習近平報導時受到關注並表示敬意。然後習近平下令進行演習。 </p><p>兩位海軍酋長都是習近平。據中國和西方分析人士稱，沉在習近平已經迅速晉升，超越了其他更高級的軍官。據中國官方軍事媒體報導，秦在2017年晉升為海軍後，曾與中國領導人在中央軍委的高級職位上密切合作。 </p><p> 2017年7月，習近平還在內蒙古Zhurihe訓練場舉行的大規模閱兵儀式上紀念中國人民解放軍成立90週年。他接受了遊行指揮官韓衛國將軍的敬禮，他是一名在福建任職的軍官，習近平是該省的政黨官員。在習近平的統治下不久，漢族就被迅速崛起，並被提升為指揮中國的地面部隊。 </p><p> “習近平痴迷於軍事遊行，”中國軍事和政治精英人才流動的資深觀察員，香港中文大學的教授威利·林沃拉說。 “他喜歡這些原始力量的示範。” </p><p>作為習近平軍事形象建設的一部分，該黨的宣傳機器將他描繪為負責中國從19世紀中期第一次鴉片戰爭開始的外國征服和殖民統治中恢復的決定性支點的領導者。 </p><p>在“強軍”紀錄片的開幕場景中，習近平於2012年12月8日在蛇口港登上導彈驅逐艦海口，自那年成為黨和軍事首腦以來首次駛入南海。當習近平通過雙筒望遠鏡望向地平線時，敘述者說道：“隨著軍艦穿越海浪，習近平同視著170年前西方列強打開大門的歷史迷霧中隱藏的異象。中國，開始為古代中國帶來痛苦的噩夢。“ </p><p>據紀錄片報導，噩夢在毛澤東領導下的共產黨勝利以及前領導人鄧，江和胡的經濟和軍事力量不斷增長的時期結束了。該系列節目顯示，隨著習近平的掌控，一支全副武裝的中國有望恢復昔日的輝煌。 </p><p>台灣壓力</p><p>除了宣傳之外，習近平在使用中國新軍事力量方面比其最近的前任更加自信。 2013年，中國開始在南海有爭議的南沙群島進行疏浚和島嶼建設，這個地區北京與菲律賓，馬來西亞，台灣，越南和文萊爭奪領土要求。 </p><p>根據2017年7月在共產黨中央黨校的官方喉舌“學習時報”的評論，習近平親自指導了這些舉動。 “這相當於在海上修建長城，”評論說。 </p><p>包括導彈電池在內的這些前哨基地的廣泛強化意味著中國實際上吞併了大片這片海洋。海軍上將菲利普戴維森在5月30日被任命為美國印度太平洋司令部負責人之前，曾告訴國會委員會，中國現在有能力在“缺乏戰爭”的所有情況下控制南中國海。 </p><p>習近平也在加大對台灣，日本和印度的軍事壓力。除了能夠打擊台灣的大量導彈外，中國海軍和空軍還開展了日益複雜的演習，定期環繞自治島。 </p><p>據台灣一些防務分析人士稱，這些演習旨在恐嚇台灣，並削弱必須應對這些演習的力量。 “他們顯然在台灣施加了很多強制力，”前台灣國防部長楊說。北京認為台灣是一個叛離的省份，並決心將其置於大陸控制之下。 </p><p>在回答路透社的問題時，台灣國防部表示將繼續保持監視並部署飛機和戰艦，以“確保我國的空中和海上領土的安全”。 </p><p>中國海軍和空軍也在通過日本島鏈增加部署，演習和巡邏的節奏。日本年度軍事白皮書去年表示，中國對日本各地活動的“單方面升級”引發了強烈的安全擔憂。日本政府本月報告稱，日本攔截器在過去一年中對中國飛機的爭奪次數增加了638次，比去年增加了近30％。 </p><p>日本國防部在回答路透社的問題時表示，“中國不僅擴大和加強了在東海，而且在太平洋和日本周邊海域的軍事活動”。 “這些活動似乎旨在提高運營能力和支持中國的存在。” </p><p>儘管採取了這些自信行動，解放軍內部仍然存在一些問題，即中國軍隊與美國和其他先進軍事大國競爭的能力。在眾多已發表的評論中，中國軍官和戰略家指出解放軍在衝突，技術缺陷和未能引入有效指揮和控制方面缺乏經驗。 </p><p>習近平的權力攫取和大膽的議程也給他個人，黨和中國帶來了巨大的風險。在中國，人們普遍猜測，軍隊的腐敗鎮壓以及黨和政府官員的平行清洗，至少部分是習近平對惡性幕後權力鬥爭的回應。 </p><p>在高級官員的重要聚會上出現了罕見的證據。在2017年10月的第19屆黨代會期間，當時的中國首席股票市場監管機構劉世玉指責一群高級官員在政治陰謀中被罷免，包括不光彩的前軍事首席郭伯雄。早些時候，官方軍事報紙暗示了類似的指控，沒有引用證據。因腐敗指控而被監禁的郭無法聯繫到評論。中國政府尚未對這一指控作進一步評論。 </p><p>習近平在領導這麼多強大的軍事和政黨領導人及其派係時，已經製造了許多危險的敵人。如果負債累累的中國經濟增長繼續放緩，軍費開支的急劇增加將更難以維持。 </p><p>儘管如此，習近平並沒有表現出降低他激勵中國軍隊的動力的跡象。 10月25日，他參觀了負責有爭議的南海的廣州市南部劇院指揮部。國家電視台向習近平穿著軍裝和戰鬥靴，高級指揮官穿過指揮所。據國家媒體報導，習近平告訴官員們要集中精力“準備戰爭和戰鬥”。 </p><p> （David Lague在香港和Benjamin Kang Lim的報導。由Peter Hirschberg編輯。）

With most of Foxconn’s facilities and workforce in China, the best way for a Taiwanese to get things done there is to stay out of the fray.</p><p>Now he wants to be the president of Taiwan. Gou says he’s seeking the nomination of the opposition Kuomintang in order to support peace across the Taiwan Strait. I believe him. And I believe that Beijing probably thinks he’s just the kind of man they need in Taipei. China’s leaders, however, would be wise to keep their hopes in check.</p><p>In declaring his candidacy, Gou described his core values as “peace, stability, economy and the future.” That’s the kind of language Beijing wants to hear from a Taiwanese leader: Those are precisely the factors it cites for forcing unification.</p><p>Note the lack of reference to distinctly Taiwanese characteristics such as democracy, human rights or free speech. While he hasn’t said so directly, Gou seems to be implying that he’ll be willing to toe Beijing’s line on what path Taiwan should take.</p><p>To understand Gou’s calculus, it’s important to understand the KMT itself. Despite attempts at reform, it is still, quite literally, the Chinese Nationalist Party. It tries to garner support from the more local Taiwan populace, but its heart and soul remain in China. To win the KMT nomination, Gou will have to convince the party’s rank-and-file that he’s their man and a better choice than its current superstar, Han Kuo-yu.</p><p>Recently elected mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, a stronghold of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Han recently made a trip to China, during which local media and politicians fawned over him -- an indication that Beijing had given its seal of approval to this new face in Taiwan politics.</p><p>As a party outsider, Gou needs to outdo Han, which means playing up his own cross-strait credentials. After all, who better to make deals with China than a man who employs a million workers there?</p><p>Yet, the other key trait I’ve noticed about Gou is that he has a knack for letting people believe what they want to believe, without necessarily making promises let alone delivering on them.</p><p>Gou is a master dealmaker. Adept at negotiating with politicians -- from provincial Chinese officials to U.S. President Donald Trump -- he almost always gets his way: tax breaks, a guaranteed supply of labor, maneuvering around environmental rules. In Indonesia, for example, he led Joko Widodo, then governor of Jakarta, to believe that iPhones could be made in the country. That helped propel Widodo into the presidency. But a failure to deliver the incentives Foxconn demanded meant that the factory never materialized.</p><p>In Wisconsin, local leaders were so desperate to get a Foxconn factory up and running they agreed to a laundry list of financial demands, and then issued six critical environmental permits in the span of three days, despite polls showing that more than half of the state’s residents were somewhat or very concerned that the plant would have a negative environmental impact.</p><p>Now Governor Tony Evers, who beat incumbent Scott Walker last year partly on the back of anti-Foxconn sentiment, says he thinks Gou’s promise of delivering 13,000 jobs will never be kept. Evers wants to renegotiate. Don’t expect Gou to jump back on his private jet to make that happen.</p><p>As a businessman, I would expect Gou’s regard for democracy, too, to take a backseat to his desire to get the best deal. But the deal he wants won’t necessarily be the one Beijing has in mind.</p><p>Chinese leaders aren’t the only ones who should be wary. Shares of various Foxconn entities initially  jumped on the belief that a President Gou would be good for the business. Yet the empire he’s built over the past 40 years has no succession plan and his previous pledges to retire have never come to fruition. To this day, nobody can give me a good answer when I ask “who would take over?” because Gou remains a hands-on micromanager.</p><p>If he were to step away, there’s every chance that the underlying businesses would falter for lack of direction. And with his key client, Apple Inc., facing its own troubles, now is hardly the time for Gou to be distracted. Gou-linked stocks fell on Friday. Whatever his latest deal is, it’s not clear it’ll be good for either investors or Beijing.</p><p>To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Nisid Hajari at nhajari@bloomberg.net</p><p>This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p><p>Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

The damage to relations will be difficult to repair even after Mr. Trump leaves office, diplomats warn, because of rising rancor and a huge erosion of trust that could lead allies to strengthen ties with other powers.</p><p>“You have a bad combination of unilateralism and narcissism,” said William J. Burns, a deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration and a 33-year foreign service veteran who wrote in a new book about the decline of diplomacy under Mr. Trump.</p><p>“We’re digging a hole for ourselves,” Mr. Burns said. “It’s not like the rest of the world is going to sit by while we get our act together. So rivals take advantage.

The United States is also working with South Korea and Japan to deal with both China and North Korea, which, unlike Iran, has a growing nuclear arsenal.</p><p>And Turkey, a fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, is a key partner in the effort to bring stability to Syria. American officials are also in negotiations with Turkey to keep it from growing too close to Russia after its decision to buy a missile defense system from Moscow.</p><p>“Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors,” the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Monday on Twitter of the Iran oil decision. Turkey is looking to continue buying Iranian oil even after its exemption from the sanctions ends on May 2.</p><p>The moves this month have strained relations well beyond the pain inflicted by Mr. Trump’s repeated denunciations of NATO allies and his withdrawals in 2017 from the global Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p><p>The backlash is evident in growing resistance among European allies to American requests to reject technology from the Chinese company Huawei in next-generation 5G telecommunications networks. Meanwhile, officials from more than 150 nations are in Beijing for a conference on China’s global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>The Trump administration has done little to assuage European allies already on edge.</p><p>Mr. Trump lifted longstanding limits on American citizens suing over property that had been confiscated by the Cuban government after the Communist revolution. European officials  strongly objected — and threatened to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization — over concerns the shift would harm foreign companies with ties to Cuba.</p><p>Administration officials threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Germany, that sought to combat the use of rape as a weapon of war. The officials demanded the measure be stripped of language on reproductive and sexual health. Several top American officials are evangelical Christians, including Mr. Pompeo, and have taken strong stands on issues related to abortion. The Security Council approved the resolution on Tuesday in a significantly weakened form.</p><p>“The current president doesn’t care about the West,” the retiring French ambassador to the United States, Gérard Araud, said in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine. “He is a nationalist. He is America alone.”</p><p>Latin American countries also are angered by the United States’ increasing intractability, even as China tries to make inroads into the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>The State Department is planning to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of what Mr. Trump has called failures to stem migration to the United States. That has weakened American warnings about doing business with China and demands that Guatemala and Honduras continue to recognize the self-governing island of Taiwan rather than China. (El Salvador already switched recognition last year, prompting a rebuke from Washington.)</p><p>But nothing has strained relations between the United States and other nations more than the anti-Iran campaign led by Mr. Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.</p><p>World powers that entered the Iran nuclear deal with the United States in 2015 objected to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal last year and the American sanctions that were later imposed. European nations have created a financial transaction system to continue doing business with Iran.</p><p>Iraqi leaders are defying American demands that they stop buying natural gas and electricity from Iran and cut ties with Iranian military officials. Iraq and the United States partnered in the fight against the Islamic State, an effort that was paralleled by Iran, which is an ally of Baghdad.</p><p>In India, officials were surprised and disappointed by the reversal on the Iranian oil purchase waivers, citing earlier assurances by Washington they would be allowed to continue buying the oil.</p><p>A senior Indian official noted that New Delhi had shown loyalty to Washington. It was weighing ending all oil imports from Venezuela — not because it agreed with the Trump administration’s hard-line position on Venezuela, but because India considers the United States a strategic partner.</p><p>The Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also expressed disappointment in the Trump administration’s decision in March to remove India from a trade program that gave the country tariff-free access to the United States. The Americans did the same to Turkey.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to trade has irritated other partner nations, including Canada, France and Japan.</p><p>“You have a big stick, and you don’t care who your interlocutor is,” Mr. Araud said. “You treat China the same way you treat the U.K. or the European Union.”</p><p>Both South Korea and Japan have endured rounds of bilateral trade negotiations with the United States. And both also asked the United States not to end the Iranian oil waivers, as did China, Iran’s biggest customer.</p><p>The United States needs help from those three nations to pressure North Korea to give up its dozens of nuclear weapons.

Biden, who served eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, enters in the middle of a Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. At 76, he is the second oldest candidate in the nominating contest, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Liberal activists criticise his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his \"Middle-Class Joe\" nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden, recently the subject of allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, in a video pledged to be \"more mindful\" of respecting \"personal space,\" an attempt to tamp down the controversy.</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS</p><p>The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum (£11.7) wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.</p><p>BETO O’ROURKE</p><p>The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping on to store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O\'Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O\'Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party\'s nominating battle, O\'Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors. </p><p>KAMALA HARRIS </p><p>The first-term senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honouring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party. </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN</p><p>The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favours the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologised earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.\"</p><p>CORY BOOKER</p><p>Booker, 49, a senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Booker, who is black, has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumours he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.</p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR</p><p>The third-term senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar\'s campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists. </p><p>JULIAN CASTRO</p><p>The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party\'s presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother immigrated to Texas from Mexico, has used his family’s personal story to criticise Trump\'s border policies. Castro advocates a universal pre-kindergarten programme, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas.</p><p>ANDREW YANG</p><p>The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York. </p><p>KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and she pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brew pub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver.</p><p>JAY INSLEE </p><p>The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012. </p><p>JOHN DELANEY</p><p>The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation. </p><p>TULSI GABBARD </p><p>The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologise for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign. </p><p>ERIC SWALWELL</p><p>The third-term congressman from a California district south of San Francisco cited tackling student debt and gun violence among the reasons he jumped into the Democratic primary race. Swalwell, 38, is among the younger candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He served on the House Intelligence Committee and founded the Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change. </p><p>TIM RYAN</p><p>The moderate nine-term congressman from a working-class district in the battleground state of Ohio has touted his appeal to the blue-collar voters who fled to Trump in 2016. He says Trump has turned his back on those voters and failed to live up his promise to revitalise the manufacturing industry. Ryan, 45, pledges to create jobs in new technologies and to focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare. He first gained national attention when he unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership. A former college football player, he also has written books on meditation and healthy eating.</p><p>SETH MOULTON</p><p>An Iraq War veteran and member of Congress, Seth Moulton, 40, was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014 when he defeated a fellow Democrat in the primary election. Moulton served in the Marines from 2001 to 2008. He became a vocal critic of the Iraq War in which he served, saying no more troops should be deployed to the country. He has advocated stricter gun laws, saying military-style weapons should not be owned by civilians. Moulton supports the legalization of marijuana and told Boston public radio station WGBH in 2016 that he had smoked pot while in college. After Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018, Moulton helped organise opposition to Representative Nancy Pelosi\'s bid to again become speaker. </p><p>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON</p><p>The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled Williamson to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.</p><p>WAYNE MESSAM</p><p>Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University\'s 1993 national championship football team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.</p><p> (Reporting by Ginger Gibson; editing by Jonathan

20歲的多元化組織正在挑戰總統唐納德特朗普（可能是共和黨候選人），其中包括六名美國參議員。創紀錄地有六位女性參賽，以及黑人，西班牙裔和公開的同性戀候選人如果其中一人成為該黨的候選人，他們將創造歷史。 </p><p>以下是發起競選活動的民主黨人，按照他們的RealClearPolitics全國民意調查平均數列出的意見調查登記者。 </p><p>喬·比登</p><p>作為民主黨總統候選人民意調查的領導者，拜登一直等到4月下旬才進入比賽 - 直接向特朗普猛烈抨擊他的出價。拜登曾在巴拉克奧巴馬總統任職八年，在美國參議院任職36年，他在民主黨辯論中是否需要一位自由派政治新人或中間派老將才能贏回白宮。 76歲的他是繼參議員伯尼桑德斯之後提名競賽中第二位最年長的候選人。自由派活動家批評他的參議院記錄，包括他的1994年犯罪行為的作者身份，導致監禁率上升，以及他與金融業的關係，這在他的家鄉特拉華州是顯著的。拜登嫉妒他的“中產階級喬”的綽號並吹捧他的工人階級根源，他在1988年和2008年的提名中未能成功競選。拜登，最近是關於與女性進行不必要的身體接觸的指控的主題，在一個視頻中承諾“更加註意”尊重“個人空間”，試圖遏制爭議。 </p><p> BERNIE SANDERS </p><p>來自佛蒙特州的參議員在2016年失去了民主黨提名，希拉里克林頓，但已經跳了第二次嘗試。在2020年的比賽中，77歲的桑德斯將不得不在一個充滿活力的進步領域中脫穎而出，兜售四年前他帶入民主黨主流的問題。他的建議包括公立大學的免費學費，最低15美元（11.7英鎊）的工資和全民醫療保健。他受益於強大的知名度和強大的小額捐贈者網絡，幫助他在比賽的第一天籌集了590萬美元。桑德斯的父親是來自波蘭的猶太移民，他在這次競選活動中表現出了更為個人化的一面，突顯了他在一個工人階級家庭中長大的掙扎。在2016年贏得少數民族選民的困難之後，他還試圖接觸黑人和西班牙裔領導人。 </p><p> BETO O&#39;ROURKE </p><p>這位前任三屆德克薩斯州國會議員於3月14日參加了比賽，並且自從向早期主要州的選民傳達樂觀信息以來，他一直專注於存儲檯面。 46歲的奧羅克去年因其創紀錄的籌款活動而名聲大噪，並且在美國參議院對共和黨現任特德克魯茲的比賽中出人意料地微弱輸掉之前吸引了大批人。奧羅克宣佈在他的競選活動的前24小時內籌集了610萬美元的籌款資金，最好的是他的民主黨對手。但隨著黨內提名戰爭的前沿政策和多元化的進步，奧羅克將面臨一個挑戰，作為一個富有的白人，他在幾個關鍵問題上比他的許多競爭對手更溫和。 </p><p>卡瑪拉哈里斯</p><p>來自加利福尼亞州的第一任參議員將成為歷史上第一位獲得提名的黑人女性。現年54歲的哈里斯是來自牙買加和印度的移民的女兒，她宣布參加紀念被殺害的民權領袖馬丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）的候選人。她對民主黨的競選產生了迅速的影響，這種競選將受到女性和少數民族選民的嚴重影響。她在競選活動的前24小時內籌集了150萬美元，並在CNN電視轉播的市政廳中獲得了創紀錄的收視率。她支持中產階級稅收抵免，Medicare for All醫療保健基金改革，綠色新政和大麻合法化。她作為舊金山地區檢察官和加利福尼亞州總檢察長的記錄已經在民主黨中受到審查，民主黨近年來在刑事司法問題上發生了變化。 </p><p> PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>這位37歲的印第安納州南本德市市長正在逐漸擺脫弱勢地位，因為他開始與年輕選民建立勢頭。他是哈佛大學的畢業生和牛津大學的羅德學者，他講七種語言，並在美國海軍預備隊服役於阿富汗。他吹噓自己是代表打擊特朗普所需的新一代領導者。 Buttigieg將成為美國一個重要政黨的第一位公開同性戀總統候選人。 </p><p> ELIZABETH WARREN </p><p>來自馬薩諸塞州的這位69歲的參議員是該黨自由黨的領導人，也是一位凶悍的華爾街評論家，他在創建消費者金融保護局方面發揮了重要作用。她把她的總統競選活動集中在她的民粹主義經濟信息上，承諾打擊她所謂的有利於富人的操縱經濟體系。她還提議取消選舉團，誓言如果當選，就會分拆亞馬遜，谷歌和Facebook，並宣誓政治籌款活動為她的出價收集現金。沃倫今年早些時候向切羅基國家道歉，因為她進行了DNA測試以證明她對美洲原住民血統的主張，這一說法促使特朗普嘲笑她稱她為“風中奇緣”。 </p><p> CORY BOOKER </p><p>現年49歲的布克是來自新澤西州和紐瓦克市前市長的參議員，他在爭奪布雷特卡瓦諾的最高法院提名方面取得了全國性的突出地位。布克是一名黑人，他將美國的種族關係和種族差異作為其競選活動的焦點，並指出歧視對其家庭的影響。他為每一位美國人，綠色新政和其他關鍵問題接受醫療保險報導的進步立場，並吹噓他對攻擊的積極性。布克吃了純素飲食，最近證實了他正在約會女演員羅薩里奧道森的謠言。 </p><p> AMY KLOBUCHAR </p><p>來自明尼蘇達州的第三任參議員是民主黨爭奪特朗普的第一位溫和派。 58歲的Klobuchar在參議院聽證會期間與Brett Kavanaugh爭吵時獲得全國關注，因為他在最高法院提名時獲得了提名。在競選活動中，前檢察官和公司律師支持替代傳統的醫療保險醫療保險基金，並對處方藥價格上漲採取強硬態度。 Klobuchar的活動報告稱其頭48小時內籌集了超過100萬美元。她的宣傳活動發布之際，有消息稱，參議院辦公室的工作人員被要求做瑣事，因此難以招聘高級別的競選戰略家。 </p><p>朱利安卡斯特羅</p><p>美國總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）領導的住房和城市發展部長將成為第一位贏得美國主要總統候選人提名的西班牙裔美國人。現年44歲的卡斯特羅的祖母從墨西哥移民到德克薩斯州，他利用家人的個人故事批評了特朗普的邊境政策。卡斯特羅提倡普及的幼兒園前計劃，支持全民醫保，並引用他的經驗來推動經濟適用房。他在他的家鄉聖安東尼奧宣布了他的出價，曾在那裡擔任過市長和市議員。他的孿生兄弟Joaquin Castro是來自德克薩斯州的民主黨國會議員。 </p><p>安德魯楊</p><p>這位企業家和前技術主管將他的競選活動重點放在雄心勃勃的全球收入計劃上。 44歲的楊希望保證所有年齡在18到64歲之間的美國公民每個月可以獲得1000美元的支票。作為來自台灣的移民的兒子，楊也在推動人人享有醫療保險，並提出一種“以人為本”的新形式的資本主義。他住在紐約。 </p><p> KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>吉利布蘭德（Gillibrand）在擔任紐約州北部的女議員時被稱為溫和派，她已經將自己變成了一個堅定的進步者，呼籲制定嚴格的槍支法並支持綠色新政。現年52歲的紐約州參議員已經領導了解決軍隊和大學校園性侵犯的問題，並敦促國會改善自己對性行為不端指控的處理。在競選活動中，她對特朗普發表了激烈的譴責。她發布了2007年到2018年的納稅申報表，提供了迄今為止最全面的2020年白宮候選人財務狀況，並呼籲她的競爭對手也這樣做。 </p><p> JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>這位67歲的前科羅拉多州州長將自己定位為具有商業經驗的中間派和經驗豐富的公務員。他是迄今為止唯一一位反對綠色新政計劃應對氣候變化的民主黨總統候選人，稱這將給政府太多的投資決策權。在他任職的兩個任期內，科羅拉多州的經濟飆升，西方國家擴大了醫療保健，通過了槍支管制法並使大麻合法化。這位前地質學家和釀酒酒吧老闆是拒絕接受公司資金的眾多候選人之一。他此前曾擔任丹佛市市長。 </p><p> JAY INSLEE </p><p>華盛頓州州長將氣候變化作為其競選活動的核心問題。作為州長，現年68歲的Inslee已暫停執行死刑並全面實施“平價醫療法案”（通常稱為奧巴馬醫改法案），並隨之擴大醫療補助計劃，為窮人提供健康保險。他尚未確定全民醫保的立場，但確實支持綠色新政，由進步人士支持。 Inslee在2012年當選州長之前在國會工作了15年。 </p><p> JOHN DELANEY </p><p>來自馬里蘭州的前美國代表成為第一位參加2020年競選的民主黨人，於2017年7月宣布他的候選資格。現年55歲的德萊尼計劃在他擔任總統職務的前100天內專注於推進兩黨法案。他還在推動全民醫療保健體系，提高聯邦最低工資標準並通過槍支安全立法。 </p><p> TULSI GABBARD </p><p>來自夏威夷和伊拉克退伍軍人的薩摩亞裔美國女議員是第一位在美國眾議院任職的印度教徒。在為父親的反同性戀倡導小組工作並起草相關立法後，她被迫為過去對同性婚姻的看法道歉。 37歲的加巴德一直反對美國對敘利亞的干涉，並在記者Jamal Khashoggi被謀殺後抨擊特朗普站在沙特阿拉伯。她在2016年總統競選期間支持了伯尼桑德斯。 </p><p> ERIC SWALWELL </p><p>來自舊金山南部加利福尼亞地區的第三屆國會議員指出，在他參加民主黨初選競選的原因中，解決學生債務和槍支暴力問題。現年38歲的斯瓦爾韋爾是爭奪2020民主黨提名的年輕候選人之一。他曾在眾議院情報委員會任職，並成立了未來論壇，該論壇由超過25位民主黨立法者組成，他們訪問大學和社區學院，討論對千禧年選民重要的問題，如學生貸款債務和氣候變化。 </p><p> TIM RYAN </p><p>來自俄亥俄州戰場上工人階級地區的溫和的九屆國會議員吹捧他對2016年逃到特朗普的藍領選民的呼籲。他說特朗普背棄了那些選民而沒有辜負他們他致力於振興製造業。現年45歲的瑞恩承諾創造新技術就業機會，並專注於公共教育和獲得負擔得起的醫療保健。他在2016年試圖取消南希佩洛西成為眾議院民主黨領袖的努力失敗後首次引起全國關注，並認為現在是時候進行新的領導了。作為一名前大學橄欖球運動員，他還撰寫有關冥想和健康飲食的書籍。 </p><p> SETH MOULTON </p><p> 40歲的伊拉克戰爭退伍軍人和國會議員Seth Moulton於2014年首次當選美國眾議院，當時他在初選中擊敗了民主黨同胞。莫爾頓於2001年至2008年在海軍陸戰隊服役。他成為伊拉克戰爭的主要批評者，他說服役的伊拉克戰爭不應該部署到該國。他主張更嚴格的槍支法，稱軍用武器不應歸平民所有。莫爾頓支持大麻合法化，並在2016年告訴波士頓公共廣播電台WGBH，他在大學期間曾抽煙。在民主黨在2018年控制眾議院之後，莫爾頓幫助組織反對代表南希佩洛西再次成為演講者。 </p><p>瑪麗安威廉森</p><p>這位66歲的“紐約時報”暢銷書作家，勵志演說家和德克薩斯本地人認為，她以靈性為重點的運動能夠治愈美國。 1992年奧普拉·溫弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey）的一次採訪推動了威廉姆森（Williamson）為好萊塢和自助專家提供了一個“精神指南”。她呼籲為10年來的奴隸制賠償1000億美元，槍支管制，教育改革以及女同性戀和同性戀社區的平等權利。 2014年，她作為一名獨立人士在加利福尼亞州的眾議院席位中未成功競標。 </p><p> WAYNE MESSAM </p><p>現年44歲的Messam在2015年擊敗了16年任職者，成為邁阿密邁阿密郊區的第一位黑人市長。他在三月份再次當選。他是牙買加移民的兒子，曾在佛羅里達州立大學1993年全國冠軍足球隊效力，然後與妻子開始建築業務。他承諾將重點放在減少槍支暴力，減緩氣候變化，減少學生貸款債務和醫療保健費用上。 </p><p> （Ginger Gibson報導; Jonathan Oatis編輯）

Under a Cold War-era treaty between the U.S. and Russia, neither country has been allowed to develop these weapons – land-based, intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (3,418 miles). But China, which isn\'t a signatory to the treaty, has been deploying these rockets in massive numbers.</p><p>Today\'s special report is part of \"The China Challenge,\" a Reuters series on how Xi Jinping is reshaping and rejuvenating China\'s military, the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), by filling its top ranks with loyal allies and enhancing its missile, naval and nuclear capabilities.</p><p>Previously in \"The China Challenge\" - Inside Xi\'s remaking of the world\'s largest fighting force: https://reut.rs/2Uzr9z4</p><p>In the event of a confrontation in the seas off its coast, Chinese military brass say they now have the means with which to keep American carriers at bay. \"We cannot defeat the United States at sea,\" a retired PLA colonel told Reuters. \"But we have missiles that specifically target aircraft carriers to stop them from approaching our territorial waters if there were conflict.\"</p><p>That is a potentially dramatic development, signaling that China is able to deter U.S. intervention as it expands its control in the South China Sea, steps up naval and air sorties around Taiwan, and extends its operations into areas it disputes with Japan.</p><p>With the United States suddenly finding itself on the wrong side of the missile gap, American military planners face a new and daunting scenario.

But there is no secret about how it plans to destroy American aircraft carriers if rivalry becomes war.</p><p>At November\'s biennial air show in the southern city of Zhuhai, the biggest state-owned missile maker, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Ltd, screened an animation showing a hostile \"blue force,\" comprising an aircraft carrier, escort ships and strike aircraft, approaching \"red force\" territory.</p><p>On a giant screen, the animation showed a barrage of the Chinese company\'s missiles launched from \"red force\" warships, submarines, shore batteries and aircraft wreaking havoc on the escort vessels around the carrier. In a final salvo, two missiles plunge onto the flight deck of the carrier and a third slams into the side of the hull near the bow.</p><p>The fate of the ship is an unmistakable message to an America that has long dominated the globe from its mighty aircraft carriers and sprawling network of hundreds of bases. China\'s military is now making giant strides toward replacing the United States as the supreme power in Asia. With the Pentagon distracted by almost two decades of costly war in the Middle East and Afghanistan, the Chinese military, the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), has exploited a period of sustained budget increases and rapid technical improvement to build and deploy an arsenal of advanced missiles.</p><p>Many of these missiles are specifically designed to attack the aircraft carriers and bases that form the backbone of U.S. military dominance in the region and which for decades have protected allies including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</p><p>Across almost all categories of these weapons, based on land, loaded on strike aircraft or deployed on warships and submarines, China\'s missiles rival or outperform their counterparts in the armories of the United States and its allies, according to current and former U.S. military officers with knowledge of PLA test launches, Taiwanese and Chinese military analysts, and technical specifications published in China\'s state-controlled media.</p><p>See the interactive version here: https://reut.rs/2Z8DetC</p><p>China has also seized a virtual monopoly in one class of conventional missiles – land-based, intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles.</p><p>Under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era agreement aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear conflict, the United States and Russia are banned from deploying this class of missiles, with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (3,418 miles). But Beijing, unrestrained by the INF Treaty, is deploying them in massive numbers.</p><p>This includes so-called carrier killer missiles like the DF-21D, which can target aircraft carriers and other warships underway at sea at a range of up to 1,500 kilometers, according to Chinese and Western military analysts. If effective, these missiles would give China a destructive capability no other military can boast. China\'s advantage in this class of missiles is likely to remain for the foreseeable future, despite U.S. President Donald Trump\'s decision in February to withdraw from the treaty in six months.</p><p>China is also making rapid strides in developing so-called hypersonic missiles, which can maneuver sharply and travel at five times the speed of sound (or even faster). Currently, the United States has no defenses against a missile like this, according to Pentagon officials.</p><p>China\'s Ministry of National Defense and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation did not respond to questions from Reuters about Beijing\'s missile capabilities. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the Pentagon had no comment.</p><p>THE MISSILE GAP</p><p>China\'s growing missile arsenal hasn\'t yet been proven in a real-world clash, and some Chinese officials play down their advances. But under the Trump administration, Washington has come to view China as a rival determined to displace the United States in Asia. This modern-day missile gap, the administration believes, is emerging as one of the biggest dangers to American military supremacy in Asia since the end of the Cold War. The Pentagon is now scrambling for new weapons and strategies to counter the PLA\'s rocket arsenal.</p><p>\"We know that China has the most advanced ballistic missile force in the world,\" said James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain and former senior intelligence officer with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. \"They have the capacity to overwhelm the defensive systems we are pursuing.\"</p><p>Fanell was sidelined by the Pentagon ahead of his 2015 retirement, after warning about the Chinese build-up at a time when President Barack Obama was seeking cooperation with Beijing. Today, Pentagon policy hews more closely to his views that China intends to displace the United States as Asia\'s dominant power.</p><p>Chinese military brass agree they can now keep American carriers at bay. Six people in China interviewed by Reuters, including retired PLA officers and a person with ties to the Beijing leadership, said China\'s enhanced missile capability was a great leveler and would serve to deter the United States from getting too close to Chinese shores.</p><p>\"We cannot defeat the United States at sea,\" a retired PLA colonel said in an interview. The United States has 11 aircraft carriers and China has just two. \"But we have missiles that specifically target aircraft carriers to stop them from approaching our territorial waters if there were conflict.\"</p><p>A person with ties to the Chinese leadership who once served in the military had a similar message: \"If U.S. aircraft carriers come too close to our coastlines in a conflict, our missiles can destroy them.\"</p><p>Xi Jinping, who has seized direct control of the world\'s largest fighting force, has played a pivotal role in the ascendancy of Chinese missile forces. This series, \"The China Challenge,\" examines how Xi is transforming the PLA and challenging U.S. supremacy in Asia. He has delivered a powerful boost to the prestige and influence of the elite unit responsible for China\'s nuclear and conventional missiles, the PLA Rocket Force.</p><p>The Chinese leader has described the missile forces as a \"core of strategic deterrence, a strategic buttress to the country\'s position as a major power and a cornerstone on which to build national security.\" Xi has brought senior missile force veterans into his closest circle of military aides as he has consolidated his grip on the PLA with a sweeping purge of senior officers accused of corruption or disloyalty.</p><p>The Rocket Force has always enjoyed strong support from the ruling Communist Party. But under Xi, the once secretive unit, formerly known as the Second Artillery Corps, has been thrust into the limelight. Since he took power in 2012 with a pledge to rejuvenate China as a great power, the Rocket Force\'s latest nuclear and conventional missiles have played a starring role at some of the biggest military parades held in the Communist era.</p><p>In one of these displays, in 2015, the designations of new missiles, including the \"carrier killer\" DF-21D, were painted on the sides of the projectiles in big white letters. The bold labels were aimed directly at  foreign audiences, according to Western military analysts monitoring the parade in Beijing. At a parade Xi presided over to mark the 90th anniversary of the PLA in 2017, missiles were also prominently displayed.</p><p>SENDING A MESSAGE</p><p>This elaborate, choreographed showcasing of the newest and most powerful missiles has provided a backdrop for Xi as he burnishes his credentials as China\'s supreme military leader. Coverage of test launches, new warheads and technical breakthroughs dominate the state-controlled military media.</p><p>But it\'s not mere theater. This concerted advertising of China\'s ability to deliver long-range conventional strikes without risking aircraft, ships or casualties is a key element of PLA strategy under Xi. Foreign military analysts say it sends a signal that China has the capacity to resist interference as it expands control over vast swathes of the South China Sea, intensifies naval and air sorties around Taiwan, and extends operations into territory it disputes with Japan in the East China Sea.</p><p>To be sure, while China\'s missile fleet has indisputably grown more formidable, the reliability, accuracy and payloads of its weapons have yet to be tested in battle. China hasn\'t fought a war since invading Vietnam in 1979. The U.S. arsenal of air and sea-launched missiles, by contrast, has been tried and proven repeatedly in wars over the past two decades.</p><p>It is also unknown if the PLA missile systems could survive electronic, cyber and physical attacks on launch facilities, guidance systems and command-and-control centers. Military analysts point out that there is still some doubt about whether China has mastered the know-how that would allow a \"carrier killer\" ballistic missile to detect, track and hit a moving target far from the Chinese coast.</p><p>U.S. military commanders and PLA watchers also acknowledge that there could be elements of subterfuge involved in the publicity about Chinese missiles. Deception is traditionally a key element of Chinese military strategy. The PLA is well aware that America and other potential rivals would be closely monitoring their test sites, according to satellite imagery specialists.</p><p>Some retired PLA officers who spoke to Reuters played down the capability of China\'s missiles.</p><p>\"U.S. missiles are superior to ours in terms of quality and quantity,\" the former PLA colonel told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic with the foreign media. \"If we were truly more advanced than the United States,\" said a Chinese military analyst, \"we would have liberated Taiwan.\"</p><p>Still, current and former U.S. military officials say they are convinced from close monitoring of China\'s numerous test firings that PLA missiles are a genuine threat.</p><p>THE RANGE WAR</p><p>What makes Chinese missiles so dangerous for the United States and its Asian allies is that the PLA is winning the \"range war,\" according to Robert Haddick, a former U.S. Marine Corps officer and now a visiting senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies based in Arlington, Virginia. While the United States was taking what Haddick describes as a \"long holiday\" from missile development in the aftermath of the Cold War, China was shooting for distance, developing missiles that can fly further than those in the armories of the United States and its Asian allies.</p><p>The Pentagon has begun to publicly acknowledge that in missiles, at least, China has the upper hand. \"We are at a disadvantage with regard to China today in the sense that China has ground-based ballistic missiles that threaten our basing in the Western Pacific and our ships,\" the former commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, Admiral Harry Harris, said in testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in March last year.</p><p>At the time, Harris explained that the United States was unable to counter with similar missiles because of the 1987 INF Treaty with Russia, which banned these weapons.</p><p>The treaty constraints have left the United States with no equivalent to weapons like China\'s DF-26 ballistic missile, which has a range of up to 4,000 km and can strike at the key U.S. base at Guam. China says the missile has a carrier-killer variant that can hit a moving target at sea. U.S. bases in South Korea and Japan are within range of another PLA projectile, the CJ-10 land attack cruise missile, which has a range of about 1,500 km, according to Pentagon estimates.</p><p>However, the Trump administration appears to be clearing the way for the United States to compete. On Feb. 1, Trump announced Washington would withdraw from the treaty, accusing Moscow of breaching the agreement. He said in a statement that the U.S. would quit in six months unless Russia returned to compliance. Trump also said that China had more than 1,000 missiles of the range covered by the INF Treaty. He added that the U.S. would now develop a ground-launched conventional missile that would have been banned under the treaty. This could help offset China\'s advantage, military experts say, but it will take time, probably years, for the U.S. to develop and deploy these weapons.</p><p>China criticized Trump\'s announcement, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang saying the treaty was important in \"safeguarding global strategic balance and stability.\" Geng, however, didn\'t mention the PLA\'s own arsenal of these weapons or that China itself isn\'t party to the pact. He said China opposed negotiating a new treaty that would cover other nations as well as Russia and America.</p><p>This missile gap portends a military upheaval. Some powerful PLA anti-ship missiles now far outrange the strike aircraft deployed on U.S. carriers. That means American military planners are grappling with a scenario that until recently didn\'t exist: U.S. carriers could be obsolete in a conflict near the Chinese mainland. If forced to operate outside the range of their aircraft when approaching China, the nuclear-powered leviathans would be far less effective. Sail too close and they would be vulnerable.</p><p>Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy has been able to use its carriers to bludgeon weaker enemies, approaching close enough to launch air strikes, confident that the giant warships are untouchable. Today, in the event of conflict with China in East Asia, Pentagon planners and other regional militaries say they are wrestling with how to respond to something they haven\'t seen since World War Two: a return to highly contested warfare at sea.</p><p>For the U.S. military, one fear is that swarms of cheap, expendable Chinese missiles have the potential to neutralize the most expensive warships ever built. China does not publish the cost of its missiles. A modern version of the subsonic, Cold-war vintage Harpoon, the mainstay anti-ship missile of the United States and its allies, costs $1.2 million, according to the U.S. Navy. Western military officials assume China\'s lower manufacturing costs would mean it could build similar missiles for less. The latest U.S. carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, cost about $13 billion to build – about 10,000 times the price of the Harpoon.</p><p>A HESITANT U.S.</p><p>For more than half a century since China\'s ruling Communist Party took power in 1949, a vast but technologically backward PLA was largely confined to the Asian mainland and coastal waters. A small force of nuclear warheads aimed at deterring a first strike comprised the only serious long-range weapons in the PLA arsenal. For most of that period, the United States and other foreign navies exercised, patrolled, snooped and routinely sailed in the waters off the Chinese coast, much as they did throughout the colonial period when China was powerless to stop foreign encroachment on its territory.</p><p>The threat from China\'s new missiles, along with rapidly increasing numbers of PLA navy submarines, means warships from the United States and other foreign navies now patrol hesitantly and infrequently in some key waterways close to the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, according to serving American officials and veterans of U.S. navy operations in Asia.</p><p>China\'s rulers have never made public the number of missiles the PLA possesses. But the Communist Youth League, the youth arm of the Communist Party, disclosed some figures on its official Twitter-like Weibo account in October 2016. China\'s Rocket Force boasts 100,000 men and possesses about 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles, about 300 medium-range ballistic missiles, 1,150 short-range ballistic missiles and 3,000 cruise missiles, the Youth League said.</p><p>According to U.S. and other Western estimates, China has about 2,000 conventional missiles that would fall within the terms of the INF missile treaty - enough to launch saturation attacks on air bases, ports or critical infrastructure in Japan, South Korea or Taiwan.</p><p>Apart from weapons covered by the INF Treaty where China has a monopoly, the PLA has other missiles in its arsenal that outperform their U.S. counterparts. These include two supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, the YJ-12, with a range of 400 km, and the YJ-18, which can hit targets up to 540 km away.</p><p>To counter these missiles, the United States relies on its subsonic, Harpoon anti-ship missile which has been modified to give it a maximum range of about 240 km. \"That is a very big gap,\" said Haddick, who is also an adviser to the U.S. Special Operations Command. \"China\'s anti-ship missile capability exceeds those of the United States in terms of range, speed and sensor performance.\"</p><p>As part of a sweeping reorganization of the Chinese armed forces, Xi in late 2015 elevated the missile force to the level of a service alongside the army, navy and air force. In a ceremony widely covered in the state-controlled media, the Second Artillery Corps was renamed the PLA Rocket Force. Two veterans of this force, General Wei Fenghe and General Zhang Shengmin, now sit on the Communist Party\'s Central Military Commission, the supreme military control body that is chaired by Xi.</p><p>Another Rocket Force veteran, General Gao Jin, is seen as a rising star of the Chinese military. When the missile force was rebadged, Gao was appointed to head a new branch of the PLA, the Strategic Support Force, which is responsible for cyber, electronic and space warfare. Gao has been a key figure in the transition of the Rocket Force from its origins as primarily a nuclear deterrent to its current dual role of both nuclear shield and spearhead of the PLA\'s conventional strike capability, according to U.S. and Chinese military analysts.</p><p>PEARL HARBOR-STYLE ATTACK</p><p>For the United States and its regional allies, a top priority is to wrest back the lead in the range war.</p><p>Extra performance is being squeezed out of old U.S. air and sea-launched missiles. Boeing is upgrading the Harpoon anti-ship missile. An anti-ship variant of Raytheon\'s venerable Tomahawk land attack cruise missile - with a range in excess of 1,600 km - is undergoing tests.</p><p>The U.S. Navy is working to add range to carrier strike aircraft, and new weapons are in the pipeline. Lockheed Martin said in December that it had delivered the first of its new, long-range anti-ship missiles to the U.S. Air Force after a series of successful tests. This stealthy missile could also be deployed on warships.</p><p>Meanwhile, China continues to improve its firepower. Two sets of satellite images on Google Earth, taken three years apart, show how China\'s Rocket Force is testing its growing arsenal.</p><p>In one, the distinctive shape of a jet fighter is clearly visible on what appears to be a mock airstrip in a remote Chinese desert. The images, captured in mid-2013 over the far west of China, show the outline of a delta-wing aircraft at the southern end of the runway. Images taken in late 2016 tell a different story. The wings and tail section are strewn at odd angles in a pile of wreckage.</p><p>\"That plane looks like it has been shot at,\" said Sean O\'Connor, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence analyst who now works as a principal research analyst at Jane\'s, the defense information company.</p><p>The replica runway, pockmarked at one end with impact craters, is part of what O\'Connor and other satellite imagery analysts have identified as a PLA missile test range. Here and at other remote sites in western China, the PLA has been blasting missiles at what appear to be simulated targets of air bases, fuel depots, ports, ships, communication hubs, radar arrays and buildings.</p><p>Some of the mock-ups appear to mimic targets in Japan and Taiwan. Satellite images of the test range with the mock airstrip also suggest China is rehearsing strikes on the key U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka in Japan and other important facilities, according to a 2017 report from two U.S. Navy officers, Commander Thomas Shugart and Commander Javier Gonzalez.</p><p>The two officers identified a mock target that appeared to be a mirror image of the inner harbor at Yokosuka base, home port for the U.S. carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group. In their report for the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based research group, the two officers said the target had outlines of angled piers similar to those at Yokosuka and the shapes of three warships about the same size as the U.S. destroyers based at the port.</p><p>The scenario Shugart and Gonzalez laid out evokes the darkest moment in American naval history. The mock-up, they wrote, could be interpreted as a rehearsal of a Pearl Harbor-style surprise attack. That paralyzing blow sank or damaged key elements of the American fleet, killed more than 2,300 Americans and plunged the United States into World War Two.

Ford）耗資約130億美元 - 約為魚叉價格的10,000倍。 </p><p>一個猶豫不決的美國</p><p>自1949年中國執政的共產黨掌權以來，半個多世紀以來，一支龐大但技術落後的解放軍主要局限於亞洲大陸和沿海水域。旨在阻止首次打擊的一小部分核彈頭是解放軍軍火庫中唯一嚴重的遠程武器。在那段時間的大部分時間裡，美國和其他外國海軍在中國沿海海域進行巡邏，巡邏，窺探和定期航行，就像整個殖民時期一樣，中國無力阻止外國侵占其領土。 </p><p>中國新型導彈的威脅以及中國人民解放軍海軍潛艇的數量迅速增加，這意味著來自美國和其他外國海軍的軍艦現在在靠近中國大陸和台灣的一些主要水道中猶豫不定，並不常巡邏。美國海軍在亞洲的業務負責人。 </p><p>中國的統治者從來沒有公開解放軍擁有的導彈數量。但共產黨的青年聯盟共青團在2016年10月的官方推特微博賬戶上披露了一些數字。中國的火箭部隊擁有10萬名男子，擁有約200枚洲際彈道導彈，約300枚中程彈道導彈。青年聯盟稱，1,150枚短程彈道導彈和3000枚巡航導彈。 </p><p>根據美國和其他西方國家的估計，中國大約有2000枚常規導彈屬於INF導彈條約 - 足以對日本，韓國或台灣的空軍基地，港口或關鍵基礎設施發動飽和攻擊。 </p><p>除了中國擁有壟斷的INF條約所涵蓋的武器之外，人民解放軍在其軍火庫中還有其他導彈，其表現優於美國同行。其中包括兩枚超音速反艦巡航導彈，YJ-12，射程400公里，以及YJ-18，可以擊中540公里以外的目標。 </p><p>為了對抗這些導彈，美國依靠其亞音速的魚叉反艦導彈進行了改進，使其最大射程達到240公里。 “這是一個非常大的差距，”哈迪克說，他也是美國特種作戰司令部的顧問。 “在射程，速度和傳感器性能方面，中國的反艦導彈能力超過了美國。” </p><p>作為中國武裝部隊全面重組的一部分，習近平於2015年底將導彈部隊提升到陸軍，海軍和空軍的服役水平。在國家控制的媒體廣泛報導的儀式中，第二砲兵部隊更名為解放軍火箭部隊。這支部隊的兩位老兵，魏豐和將軍和張勝民將軍，現坐在共產黨的中央軍事委員會上，這是由習近平主持的最高軍事控制機構。 </p><p>另一名火箭部隊老兵高金將軍被視為中國軍隊的後起之秀。當導彈部隊被重新安置時，高智晟被任命為解放軍的新分支機構 - 戰略支援部隊，負責網絡，電子和太空戰。根據美國和中國軍事分析人士的說法，高智晟一直是火箭部隊過渡的關鍵人物，從其起源主要是核威懾，再到目前解放軍常規打擊能力的核盾和矛頭的雙重角色。 </p><p> PEARL HARBOR-STYLE ATTACK </p><p>對於美國及其地區盟國來說，首要任務是奪回範圍戰爭中的領先優勢。 </p><p>美國空中和海上發射的導彈正在擠出額外的性能。波音公司正在升級Harpoon反艦導彈。雷神公司著名的戰斧陸地攻擊巡航導彈的反艦變型 - 射程超過1,600公里 - 正在接受測試。 </p><p>美國海軍正在努力增加航母攻擊機的航程，新武器正在籌備中。洛克希德·馬丁公司在去年12月表示，在經過一系列成功試驗後，它已向美國空軍交付了第一枚新型遠程反艦導彈。這種隱形導彈也可以部署在戰艦上。 </p><p>與此同時，中國繼續提高火力。谷歌地球上的兩組衛星圖像相隔三年，展示了中國的火箭部隊如何測試其不斷增長的軍火庫。 </p><p>在其中一個，噴氣式戰鬥機的獨特形狀清晰可見在中國偏遠的沙漠中似乎是一個模擬簡易機場。這些照片於2013年中期在中國西部拍攝，顯示了跑道南端三角翼飛機的輪廓。 2016年底拍攝的照片講述了一個不同的故事。翅膀和尾部在一堆殘骸中以奇怪的角度散落。 </p><p>美國前空軍情報分析師肖恩·奧康納說：“那架飛機看起來像是被擊中了。”他現在擔任國防信息公司Jane&#39;s的主要研究分析師。 </p><p>複製品跑道的一端有撞擊坑，是O&#39;Connor和其他衛星圖像分析師確定的解放軍導彈測試範圍的一部分。在這里以及中國西部的其他偏遠地區，解放軍一直在向空軍基地，油庫，港口，船舶，通信樞紐，雷達陣列和建築物的模擬目標發射導彈。 </p><p>一些模型似乎模仿了日本和台灣的目標。根據兩名美國海軍軍官，指揮官托馬斯·舒加特和指揮官哈維爾·岡薩雷斯的2017年報告，模擬簡易機場的測試範圍的衛星圖像也表明中國正在排練日本橫須賀的主要美國海軍基地和其他重要設施的罷工。 </p><p>這兩名軍官發現了一個模擬目標，似乎是橫須賀基地內港的鏡像，是美國航母羅納德里根及其戰鬥群的主港。這兩名官員在其位於華盛頓的研究小組新美國安全中心的報告中說，該目標的輪廓與橫須賀相似，以及與美國驅逐艦相同大小的三艘戰艦的形狀。在港口。 </p><p> Shugart和Gonzalez所設想的場景喚起了美國海軍歷史上最黑暗的時刻。他們寫道，這些模型可能被解釋為珍珠港式突擊襲擊的排練。這場癱瘓的打擊沉沒或損壞了美國艦隊的關鍵部隊，造成2300多名美國人喪生，並使美國陷入第二次世界大戰。但是日本人沒有因為他們在海上而沉沒在珍珠港的美國航空母艦。 </p><p>在最近在珠海舉行的中國航展動畫中，“紅軍”並沒有犯同樣的錯誤。在紅色導彈擊中藍色力量載體之後，動畫結束時說：“防禦性反擊行動已經取得了預期效果。” </p><p> （David Lague在中國珠海和Benjamin Kang Lim的報導。由Peter Hirschberg編輯） </p>'),(266,7,'https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/25/world/asia/25reuters-taiwan-france-warship-china-exclusive.html?searchResultPosition=8','Exclusive: In Rare Move, French Warship Passes Through Taiwan Strait',NULL,'\"China’s military sent navy ships in accordance with the law and the rules to identify the French ship and warn it to leave,\" defense ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang told a regularly scheduled media briefing, while declining to say if the sailing had led to the withdrawal of France\'s invitation to the parade of ships this week.\"',' Reuters','2019-04-25',1556150400000,'<p>WASHINGTON — A French warship passed through the strategic Taiwan Strait this month, U.S. officials told Reuters, a rare voyage by a vessel of a European country that is likely to be welcomed by Washington but increase tension with Beijing.</p><p>The passage, which was confirmed by China, is a sign that U.S. allies are increasingly asserting freedom of navigation in international waterways near China.

The slogan is part of an exhibit about the history of the structure, which was built to house the offices of the colonial governor sent from Japan. It later served as the seat of administrators dispatched from Beijing and then of the dictators who ruled Taiwan after its split from China in 1949. For the past 22 years, however, it has hosted Taiwan’s democratically elected presidents. The ground floor is open to the public every weekday morning—no booking required.</p><p>Such openness is one of the many ways in which power does indeed rest with the people in Taiwan. On a recent visit Banyan faced tighter security getting into his hotel than into the offices of members of parliament. He was also slightly befuddled to be told by Audrey Tang, the minister in charge of digital outreach, that she practised a policy of “radical transparency” and that transcripts of all her meetings, including any interviews, are published online ten working days after the event (she leaves the room when the cabinet starts talking about national security).</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Then there is the law on referendums, which was amended in 2017 to make it easier to get them on the ballot. Even though there are competitive elections, a free and diverse press and an ingrained culture of mass protest about everything from nuclear power to public pensions, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) decided that it was not easy enough for ordinary people to make their voices heard. Now any question for which activists can muster the signatures of 1.5% of the electorate earns a spot on the ballot. At nationwide local elections in November, nine made the cut. The government must act on the results, provided the turnout is high enough—which it was.</p><p>By any standard, let alone that of most countries in the region, democracy in Taiwan is thriving. Yet, by the admission of Tsai Ing-wen, the president, it faces a potentially fatal threat: “China’s attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan’s internal politics and social development”. Her government, which did very badly in the elections, accused China of meddling in them by spreading disinformation, steering money to the opposition and inducing Taiwanese media to provide slanted coverage. China’s president, Xi Jinping, seemed implicitly to acknowledge such a campaign earlier this month when he gleefully declared that China had won “a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement”—an apparent reference to the electoral defeat of Ms Tsai’s DPP, which would like to abandon the idea that Taiwan and China will eventually be unified and instead officially declare Taiwan a separate country.</p><p>Ms Tang talks excitedly about countering Chinese disinformation by getting the government to respond faster to online falsehoods. She wants official denials to appear within four hours. Ms Tsai says she has instructed the security services to prepare countermeasures. That is all well and good, but it is really another way of saying that the government does not know what it can do. Big Taiwanese firms have invested heavily in China. It is the easiest thing in the world for the Chinese government to signal to them that, if they want their investments to prosper, they should donate money to certain politicians back home, or even purchase a media outlet that propagates views considered distasteful by the Chinese leadership, to institute friendlier coverage.</p><p>There are plenty of ways for China to influence humbler voters, too. It cut off the flow of package tourists to signal its disapproval after Ms Tsai was elected in 2016, hurting small businesses. Analysts expect a flood of tourists to Kaohsiung, the third-biggest city and a DPP stronghold, after it unexpectedly chose a mayor from the opposition Kuomintang, which advocates warmer relations with China. And since a tenth of working-age Taiwanese live in China, and 29% of exports go there, voters are reluctant to antagonise their looming neighbour.</p><p>There is a horrible irony in the fact that Taiwan has succeeded in instituting a model democracy in which all big decisions are up to voters except the one that seems most important: whether Taiwan should be a country at all. Indeed, the referendum law makes that explicit, by allowing votes on any subject except cross-strait relations. Taiwan may have transferred power to its people, in short, but China has already begun to yank it away from them.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1556445997020','[\"228\", \"237\", \"306\"]',0,'即使台灣完善民主，中國也在破壞它','除了真正重要的事情之外，選民決定一切','中國國家主席習近平本月早些時候似乎含蓄地承認這樣一場運動，當時他興高采烈地宣稱中國贏得了“挫敗台獨運動的巨大勝利” - 明顯提到蔡英文的民進黨選舉失敗，喜歡放棄台灣和中國最終統一的觀點，而是正式宣布台灣為一個獨立的國家。','<p> “人民的力量”讀到了台北最宏偉的老建築樓層新裝飾的文字。這個口號是關於建築歷史的展覽的一部分，該建築是為了容納從日本派出的殖民地總督的辦公室而建造的。它後來成為從北京派出的管理者的所在地，然後是1949年從中國分裂後統治台灣的獨裁者。然而，在過去的22年裡，台灣民主選舉產生了總統。一樓每個工作日的早晨都向公眾開放 - 無需預訂。 </p><p>這種開放態度是台灣人民確實依賴權力的眾多方式之一。在最近的一次訪問中，榕樹進入酒店的安全性比進入議會辦公室更嚴格。負責數字外展的部長奧黛麗·唐（Audrey Tang）告訴他，她實行了“激進透明”的政策，並且她所有會議的成績單，包括任何訪談，都在網上發布後十個工作日內，也讓他感到有些迷茫。事件（當內閣開始談論國家安全時，她離開了房間）。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>然後是2017年修訂的全民公決法，以便更容易讓他們參加投票。即使有競爭性的選舉，自由多樣的新聞報導以及從核電到公共養老金的大規模抗議的根深蒂固的文化，執政的民進黨（DPP）決定讓普通人發出自己的聲音並不容易聽到。現在，任何積極分子可以召集1.5％選民簽名的問題都可以在選票上獲得一席之地。在11月舉行的全國性地方選舉中，有9人晉級。只要投票率足夠高，政府就必須對結果採取行動。 </p><p>按照任何標準，更不用說該地區大多數國家的標準，台灣的民主正在蓬勃發展。然而，在總統蔡英文被接納後，它面臨著一個潛在的致命威脅：“中國企圖利用我們民主制度的開放和自由來干涉台灣的內部政治和社會發展”。她的政府在選舉中做得非常糟糕，指責中國通過散佈虛假信息，向反對派轉移資金以及誘使台灣媒體提供傾斜報導來干預他們。中國國家主席習近平本月早些時候似乎含蓄地承認這樣一場運動，當時他興高采烈地宣稱中國贏得了“挫敗台獨運動的巨大勝利” - 明顯提到蔡英文的民進黨選舉失敗，喜歡放棄台灣和中國最終統一的觀點，而是正式宣布台灣為一個獨立的國家。 </p><p>唐女士激動地談到通過讓政府更快地回應在線謊言來打擊中國的虛假信息。她希望官方拒絕在四小時內出庭。蔡女士說，她已指示安保部門準備對策。這一切都很好，但這是另一種說政府不知道它能做什麼的方式。大型台灣公司在中國投入巨資。世界上最容易讓中國政府向他們發出信號，即如果他們希望自己的投資能夠繁榮，就應該向在國內的某些政治家捐款，或者甚至購買一個媒體來宣傳中國人認為令人反感的觀點。領導，建立更友好的報導。 </p><p>中國也有很多方式來影響更加謙遜的選民。在蔡女士於2016年當選後，它打斷了包裹遊客的流動，表明其不贊成，傷害了小企業。分析人士預計會有大量遊客湧入高雄，這是第三大城市和民進黨的據點，因為它出人意料地選擇了反對派國民黨的市長，後者主張與中國建立更溫暖的關係。由於十分之一的工作年齡的台灣人生活在中國，29％的出口都在那裡，選民們不願反對他們迫近的鄰居。 </p><p>台灣已經成功建立了一個模範民主，其中所有重大決策都取決於選民，除了一個看起來最重要的決定：台灣應該是一個國家，這是一個可怕的諷刺。實際上，公民投票法通過允許對除兩岸關係以外的任何主題進行投票來明確表明這一點。簡而言之，台灣可能已經將權力轉移給了人民，但中國已經開始將它從它們身上拉開。 </p>'),(304,8,'https://qz.com/quartzy/1601309/liu-xias-photos-in-taiwan-show-a-long-grief-over-liu-xiaobo/','Liu Xia’s unsettling photos of dolls reveal the emotional toll of loving a Chinese dissident','null','Entitled Atemschaukel,  the exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei (MOCA Taipei), which opened March 30, showcases 26 of the black-and-white photographs that Liu Xia took between 1996 and 1999 when Liu Xiaobo was sent to a labor camp for writing a letter against party rule.','Vivienne Chow','2019-05-01T09:09:34.000Z',1556701774000,'<p>Liu Xia might be reluctant to talk about her past in public since she was released from house arrest in China last July, and began a new life in Germany, but her photographs and poems speak louder than words.</p><p>One of the first shows of the 58-year-old artist’s works since her exile is now on display in Taiwan, where photographs alongside some of her poems, offer a glimpse of the decades of emotional distress and despair she has lived through.

He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana.

He is also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation.  </p><p>ERIC SWALWELL</p><p>The third-term congressman from a district south of San Francisco cited tackling student debt and gun violence among the reasons he jumped into the Democratic primary race. Swalwell, 38, is among the younger candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He served on the House Intelligence Committee and founded the Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change. </p><p>TIM RYAN</p><p>The moderate nine-term congressman from a working-class district in the battleground state of Ohio has touted his appeal to the blue-collar voters who fled to Trump in 2016. Ryan, 45, pledges to create jobs in new technologies and to focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare. He first gained national attention when he unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership. A former college football player, he also has written books on meditation and healthy eating.</p><p>SETH MOULTON</p><p>An Iraq War veteran and member of Congress, Moulton, 40, was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014. Moulton served in the Marines from 2001 to 2008. He became a vocal critic of the Iraq War, saying no more troops should be deployed to the country. He has advocated stricter gun laws, saying military-style weapons should not be owned by civilians. Moulton supports the legalization of marijuana and told a Boston radio station in 2016 that he had smoked pot while in college. After Democrats took control of the House in 2018, Moulton helped organize opposition to Nancy Pelosi\'s bid to again become speaker. </p><p>MICHAEL BENNET </p><p>Bennet, 54, who is serving his second full six-year term as a senator for Colorado, has centered his political career on improving the American education system. He previously ran Denver\'s public schools. Bennet is not well known nationally, but has built a network of political operatives and donors helping elect other Democrats to the Senate. During the partial U.S. government shutdown in January, he garnered national attention criticizing Republicans for stopping the flow of emergency funds to Colorado. </p><p>THE LONG SHOTS </p><p>Bulking the ranks of presidential hopefuls is a group of unlikely candidates, hoping to parlay a disdain for insiders into an improbable run for the presidency. </p><p>MIKE GRAVEL</p><p>The 88-year-old former senator made a little-known run for the Democratic nomination in 2008 and is taking another stab at the White House. One of his top issues is advocating for direct democracy, which would remove power from Congress and have voters decide policy changes. Gravel represented Alaska in the U.S. Senate from 1969 to 1981. He lost reelection in the 1980 race. Since leaving the Senate, Gravel worked in real estate and finance. In 2008, after failing to gain any traction in the Democratic contest, he also made an unsuccessful bid to be the Libertarian nominee for president.</p><p>WAYNE MESSAM</p><p>Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University\'s 1993 national championship football team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.</p><p>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON</p><p>The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled Williamson to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.</p><p>THE REPUBLICANS</p><p>President Trump is the clear favorite to win the Republican nomination and there has been criticism among his opponents that party leadership have worked to make it impossible for a challenger. But he will still face at least one challenger. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP </p><p>Serving in his first term, the 72-year-old real estate mogul shocked the political establishment in 2016 when he successfully secured the Republican nomination and then won the White House. His raucous political rallies and prolific use of Twitter were credited with helping him secure victory. After running as an outsider, Trump is now focusing his message on the strong economy and criticism of Democrats as he vies for reelection. </p><p>BILL WELD</p><p>Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld is mounting a long-shot bid to unseat Trump in the Republican primary. Weld ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016 as a Libertarian. He has been a persistent critic of Trump, saying when he launched his 2020 campaign that \"the American people are being ignored and our nation is suffering.\"</p><p>(In 2nd paragraph, corrects to say \"more than 20\" are challenging Trump, not \"group of 20,\" and corrects to say the group includes seven U.S. senators, not six. In 3rd and 5th paragraphs, deletes extra words. In 25th paragraph, corrects to say Bennet is serving his second full six-year term as a senator, not that he is a six-term senator.) </p><p> (Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Alistair

TRUMP這位72歲的房地產大亨在他的第一個任期內服務，震驚了2016年的政治機構，當時他成功地獲得了共和黨提名，然後贏得了白宮。','<p>華盛頓 - 現代美國政治時代最大的民主黨領域正在爭奪該黨2020年總統候選人提名。 </p><p> 20多名競選總統唐納德特朗普（可能是共和黨候選人）的多元化團體包括七名美國參議員。創紀錄地有六位女性參賽，以及黑人，西班牙裔和公開的同性戀候選人如果其中一人成為該黨的候選人，他們將創造歷史。 </p><p>一些候選人開始獲得牽引力。其他人仍在尋找突破的機會。而第三層則被那些仍然完整的長鏡頭所佔據。 </p><p>兩名共和黨人也在競爭他們黨的提名。 </p><p>民主頂級</p><p>以下是RealClearPolitics全國民意調查平均排名前10位的民主黨人。 </p><p>喬·比登</p><p>作為民主黨總統候選人民意調查的領導者，拜登一直等到4月下旬才進入比賽 - 直接向特朗普猛烈抨擊他的出價。現年76歲的拜登在美國參議院總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）擔任副總統長達8年，在美國參議院任職36年，他在民主黨辯論中是否需要自由派政治新人或中間派退伍軍人才能贏回白宮。拜登喜歡他的“中產階級喬”綽號並吹捧他的工人階級根源。 </p><p> BERNIE SANDERS </p><p>來自佛蒙特州的參議員在2016年失去了民主黨提名，希拉里克林頓，但已經跳了第二次嘗試。在2020年的比賽中，77歲的桑德斯將不得不在一個充滿活力的進步領域中脫穎而出，兜售四年前他帶入民主黨主流的問題。他的建議包括公立大學的免費學費，15美元的最低工資和全民醫療保健。他受益於強大的知名度和強大的小額捐贈者網絡。 </p><p> ELIZABETH WARREN </p><p>這位來自馬薩諸塞州的69歲參議員是該黨自由黨的領導人，也是華爾街的一位激烈批評者，他在創建消費者金融保護局方面發揮了重要作用。她把她的總統競選活動集中在她的民粹主義經濟信息上，承諾打擊她所謂的有利於富人的操縱經濟體系。她還建議取消選舉團，分拆科技公司，並宣誓政治籌款活動，以收集她的出價。 </p><p> PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>這位37歲的印第安納州南本德市市長正在逐漸擺脫弱勢地位，因為他開始與年輕選民建立勢頭。他是哈佛大學的畢業生和牛津大學的羅德學者，他講七種語言，並在美國海軍預備隊服役於阿富汗。他吹噓自己是代表打擊特朗普所需的新一代領導者。 Buttigieg將成為美國一個重要政黨的第一位公開同性戀總統候選人。 </p><p>卡瑪拉哈里斯</p><p>來自加利福尼亞州的第一任參議員將成為歷史上第一位獲得提名的黑人女性。現年54歲的哈里斯，來自牙買加和印度的移民的女兒，宣布她參加了紀念被殺害的民權領袖馬丁路德金的假期。她支持中產階級稅收抵免，醫療保險全部醫療保健基金改革，綠色新政和大麻合法化。她作為舊金山地區檢察官和加利福尼亞州總檢察長的記錄已經在民主黨中受到審查，民主黨近年來在刑事司法問題上發生了變化。 </p><p> BETO O&#39;ROURKE </p><p>這位前任三屆德克薩斯州國會議員於3月14日參加了比賽，並且自從向早期主要州的選民傳達樂觀信息以來，他一直專注於存儲檯面。 46歲的奧羅克去年因其創紀錄的籌款活動而名聲大噪，並且在美國參議院對共和黨現任特德克魯茲的比賽中出人意料地微弱輸掉之前吸引了大批人。奧羅克宣佈在他的競選活動的前24小時內籌集了610萬美元的籌款資金，最好的是他的民主黨對手。但隨著黨內提名戰爭的前沿政策和多元化的進步，奧羅克將面臨一個挑戰，作為一個富有的白人，他在幾個關鍵問題上比他的許多競爭對手更溫和。 </p><p> CORY BOOKER </p><p>現年50歲的布克是來自新澤西州和紐瓦克市前市長的參議員，他在爭奪布雷特卡瓦諾的最高法院提名時獲得了全國性的重要地位。布克是一名黑人，他將美國的種族關係和種族差異作為其競選活動的焦點，並指出歧視對其家庭的影響。他為每一位美國人，綠色新政和其他關鍵問題接受醫療保險報導的進步立場，並吹噓他對攻擊的積極性。布克吃了純素飲食，最近證實了他正在約會女演員羅薩里奧道森的謠言。 </p><p> AMY KLOBUCHAR </p><p>來自明尼蘇達州的第三任參議員是民主黨爭奪特朗普的第一位溫和派。 58歲的Klobuchar在參議院聽證會期間與Brett Kavanaugh爭吵時獲得全國關注，因為他在最高法院提名時獲得了提名。在競選活動中，前檢察官和公司律師支持替代傳統的醫療保險醫療保險基金，並對處方藥價格上漲採取強硬態度。 Klobuchar的活動報告稱其頭48小時內籌集了超過100萬美元。她的宣傳活動發布之際，有消息稱，參議院辦公室的工作人員被要求做瑣事，因此難以招聘高級別的競選戰略家。 </p><p>安德魯楊</p><p>這位企業家和前技術主管將他的競選活動重點放在雄心勃勃的全球收入計劃上。 44歲的楊希望保證所有年齡在18到64歲之間的美國人每月1000美元的支票。作為來自台灣的移民的兒子，楊也在推動人人享有醫療保險，並提出一種“以人為本”的新形式的資本主義。他住在紐約。 </p><p>朱利安卡斯特羅</p><p>美國總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）領導的住房和城市發展部長將成為第一位贏得美國主要總統候選人提名的西班牙裔美國人。現年44歲的卡斯特羅的祖母從墨西哥移民到德克薩斯州，他利用家人的個人故事批評了特朗普的邊境政策。卡斯特羅提倡普及的幼兒園前計劃，支持全民醫保，並引用他的經驗來推動經濟適用房。他在他的家鄉聖安東尼奧宣布了他的出價，曾在那裡擔任過市長和市議員。他的孿生兄弟Joaquin Castro是來自德克薩斯州的民主黨國會議員。 </p><p> TULSI GABBARD </p><p>來自夏威夷和伊拉克退伍軍人的薩摩亞裔美國女議員是第一位在美國眾議院任職的印度教徒。在為父親的反同性戀倡導小組工作並起草相關立法後，她被迫為過去對同性婚姻的看法道歉。 37歲的加巴德因在2017年與敘利亞總統巴沙爾·阿薩德會面而受到批評。在記者Jamal Khashoggi被謀殺後，她抨擊特朗普站在沙特阿拉伯。她在2016年總統競選期間支持了伯尼桑德斯。 </p><p> JAY INSLEE </p><p>華盛頓州州長將氣候變化作為其競選活動的核心問題。作為州長，現年68歲的Inslee已暫停執行死刑並全面實施“平價醫療法案”（通常稱為奧巴馬醫改法案），並隨之擴大醫療補助計劃，為窮人提供健康保險。他尚未確定全民醫保的立場，但確實支持綠色新政，由進步人士支持。 Inslee在2012年當選州長之前在國會工作了15年。 </p><p>嘗試突破</p><p>該領域還包括幾位已經擔任公職的民主黨人，他們設法建立了一個早期籌款基地，並試圖找到突破的方法。 </p><p> KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>吉利布蘭德（Gillibrand）在擔任紐約州北部的女議員時被稱為溫和派，她已經將自己變成了一個堅定的進步者，呼籲制定嚴格的槍支法並支持綠色新政。現年52歲的紐約州參議員已經領導了解決軍隊和大學校園性侵犯的問題，並敦促國會改善自己對性行為不端指控的處理。在競選活動中，她對特朗普發表了激烈的譴責。她發布了2007年到2018年的納稅申報表，提供了迄今為止最全面的2020年白宮候選人財務狀況，並呼籲她的競爭對手也這樣做。 </p><p> JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>這位67歲的前科羅拉多州州長將自己定位為具有商業經驗的中間派和經驗豐富的公務員。他是迄今為止唯一一位反對綠色新政計劃應對氣候變化的民主黨總統候選人，稱這將給政府太多的投資決策權。在他任職的兩個任期內，科羅拉多州的經濟飆升，西方國家擴大了醫療保健，通過了槍支管制法並使大麻合法化。這位前地質學家和釀酒酒吧老闆是拒絕接受公司資金的眾多候選人之一。他此前曾擔任丹佛市市長。 </p><p> JOHN DELANEY </p><p>來自馬里蘭州的前美國代表成為第一位參加2020年競選的民主黨人，於2017年7月宣布他的候選人資格。現年56歲的德萊尼計劃在他擔任總統職務的前100天內專注於推進兩黨法案。他還在推動全民醫療保健體系，提高聯邦最低工資標準並通過槍支安全立法。 </p><p> ERIC SWALWELL </p><p>來自舊金山南部地區的第三屆國會議員指出，在他參加民主黨初選的原因中，解決了學生債務和槍支暴力問題。現年38歲的斯瓦爾韋爾是爭奪2020民主黨提名的年輕候選人之一。他曾在眾議院情報委員會任職，並成立了未來論壇，該論壇由超過25位民主黨立法者組成，他們訪問大學和社區學院，討論對千禧年選民重要的問題，如學生貸款債務和氣候變化。 </p><p> TIM RYAN </p><p>來自俄亥俄州戰場上工人階級區的溫和的九屆國會議員吹捧他對2016年逃往特朗普的藍領選民的吸引力.45歲的瑞安承諾創造新技術的工作並專注於公共教育和獲得負擔得起的醫療保健他在2016年試圖取消南希佩洛西成為眾議院民主黨領袖的努力失敗後首次引起全國關注，並認為現在是時候進行新的領導了。作為一名前大學橄欖球運動員，他還撰寫有關冥想和健康飲食的書籍。 </p><p> SETH MOULTON </p><p> 40歲的莫爾頓退伍軍人和國會議員，40歲的莫爾頓，於2014年首次入選美國眾議院。莫爾頓於2001年至2008年在海軍陸戰隊服役。他成為伊拉克戰爭的直言不諱的批評者。被部署到該國。他主張更嚴格的槍支法，稱軍用武器不應歸平民所有。莫爾頓支持大麻合法化，並在2016年告訴波士頓廣播電台，他在大學期間曾抽煙。在民主黨在2018年控制眾議院之後，莫爾頓幫助組織反對南希佩洛西再次成為演講者。 </p><p> MICHAEL BENNET </p><p>現年54歲的班納特正在為科羅拉多州參議員擔任第二個完整的六年任期，他的政治生涯集中在改善美國教育體系上。他以前經營過丹佛的公立學校。班納特在全國范圍內並不為人所知，但已經建立了一個由政治人員和捐助者組成的網絡，幫助選舉其他民主黨參議員。在1月美國政府部分關閉期間，他引起國家的注意，批評共和黨人阻止向科羅拉多州提供緊急資金。 </p><p>長期拍攝</p><p>擴大總統候選人的隊伍是一群不太可能的候選人，希望能夠讓內部人士不屑一動地擔任總統職位。 </p><p> MIKE GRAVEL </p><p>這位88歲的前參議員在2008年為民主黨提名做了一個鮮為人知的競選活動，並再次向白宮進行了抨擊。他的一個主要議題是倡導直接民主，這將取消國會的權力，並讓選民決定政策變化。 1969年至1981年，格拉維爾在美國參議院代表阿拉斯加。他在1980年的比賽中失去了連任。自離開參議院以來，Gravel一直從事房地產和金融業務。 2008年，在未能在民主黨競選中獲得任何牽引力之後，他也未能成為自由派總統候選人。 </p><p> WAYNE MESSAM </p><p>現年44歲的Messam在2015年擊敗了16年任職者，成為邁阿密邁阿密郊區的第一位黑人市長。他在三月份再次當選。他是牙買加移民的兒子，曾在佛羅里達州立大學1993年全國冠軍足球隊效力，然後與妻子開始建築業務。他承諾將重點放在減少槍支暴力，減緩氣候變化，減少學生貸款債務和醫療保健費用上。 </p><p>瑪麗安威廉森</p><p>這位66歲的“紐約時報”暢銷書作家，勵志演說家和德克薩斯本地人認為，她以靈性為重點的運動能夠治愈美國。 1992年奧普拉·溫弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey）的一次採訪推動了威廉姆森（Williamson）為好萊塢和自助專家提供了一個“精神指南”。她呼籲為10年來的奴隸制賠償1000億美元，槍支管制，教育改革以及女同性戀和同性戀社區的平等權利。 2014年，她作為一名獨立人士在加利福尼亞州的眾議院席位中未成功競標。 </p><p>共和黨人</p><p>特朗普總統是贏得共和黨提名的最佳人選，他的反對者一直批評黨派領導層努力使挑戰者無法接受。但他仍然會面對至少一個挑戰者。 </p><p>唐納德·特朗普</p><p>這位72歲的房地產大亨在他的第一個任期內服務，震驚了2016年的政治機構，當時他成功獲得共和黨提名，然後贏得了白宮。他喧鬧的政治集會和對Twitter的大量使用被認為有助於他獲得勝利。在作為局外人跑步後，特朗普正在將他的信息集中在強大的經濟和民主黨人的批評上，因為他爭奪連任。 </p><p> BILL WELD </p><p>前馬薩諸塞州州長威爾·威爾德（William Weld）正試圖在共和黨初選中取代特朗普。作為自由主義者，韋爾德在2016年未能成功擔任總統。他一直是特朗普的批評者，他說，當他發起2020年的競選活動時，“美國人民被忽視，我們的國家正在受苦”。 </p><p> （在第2段，糾正說“超過20”正在挑戰特朗普，而不是“20人組”，並糾正說該組包括7名美國參議員，而不是6名。在第3和第5段，刪除額外的詞。在25日段落，糾正說Bennet作為參議員服務他的第二個完整的六年任期，而不是他是一個六任參議員。） </p><p> （Ginger Gibson報導; Alistair Bell編輯）

Powerful spotlights are sometimes trained directly on the ocean frontages of neighboring hotels at night, making visibility out to sea virtually impossible. Some of the lights are mounted on land and others on passing naval patrol boats.</p><p>\"The effect is incredible,\" said one recent visitor. \"The glare is so great you can hardly stand it on the balcony. You go inside and draw the curtains tight.\"</p><p>The blinding lights cannot obscure something of intense interest to the world\'s military intelligence agencies: evidence that China has made a breakthrough in its drive to rival America and Russia as a nuclear arms power.</p><p>Satellite imagery reveals the regular presence of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines at the strategic base near the resort city of Sanya. Specialized surface warships and aircraft designed to protect the subs are prowling key waterways off the coast. Facilities at the base appear to have been built to store and load ballistic missiles. Antenna arrays that support the hunt for foreign submarines have appeared on Chinese-held islands in the hotly contested South China Sea. And a veteran submariner has been appointed to command Chinese forces in the south of the country.</p><p>Taken together, this means China has a force of missile submarines that can launch nuclear attacks from beneath the waves and now appear to be heading out on patrols, according to serving and retired naval officers, diplomats and security analysts. That gives Beijing something it has until recently lacked: a more reliable \"second strike\" capability if its land-based nuclear arsenal comes under attack.</p><p>See the interactive version here: https://reut.rs/2ZO6ar9</p><p>After six decades of battling to master complex and challenging subsea military technologies, China has joined the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and France in the nuclear ballistic missile submarine club. In its most explicit assessment so far of this Chinese capability, the Pentagon in its latest annual report on China\'s military, published in August, said that Beijing now has a \"credible\" and \"viable\" sea-based nuclear deterrent.</p><p>An effective fleet of nuclear ballistic missile submarines, known as SSBNs, marks a dramatic boost to China\'s nuclear capabilities. Each of China\'s four Jin-class submarines is armed with up to 12 ballistic missiles that can carry a nuclear warhead with an estimated range of 7,200 kilometers (about 4,500 miles), according to the Pentagon. That would put the United States within striking distance from the Western Pacific. Analysts at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimate these missiles could fly at least 8,000 kilometers. The U.S. believes China has up to 100 nuclear missiles based on land.</p><p>Beijing\'s enhanced nuclear capability is one of the hallmarks of Chinese leader Xi Jinping\'s ambitious revamping of the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), the world\'s largest fighting force. China\'s nuclear submarine fleet, Western strategists say, has added to the challenge that the increasingly powerful Chinese military poses to U.S. dominance in Asia.</p><p>\"The opposing side can never be exactly sure that it knows where all of the submarines are,\" said Peter Horobin, a retired Australian submarine commander and veteran of the Cold War battles to detect and monitor Soviet subs.</p><p>China\'s Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters.</p><p>It is still unclear if the Chinese are deploying fully armed submarines to maintain a round-the-clock deterrent, as the other ballistic missile submarine powers do. Some analysts doubt China has advanced that far.</p><p>But the United States and its allies are behaving as if China has. Western military officials say privately that in operational terms, America and its allies - including Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom - are already attempting to track the movements of China\'s missile submarines as if they are fully armed and on deterrence patrols.</p><p>Asked about their role in tracking Chinese subs, Japan and the United Kingdom said they don\'t comment on operational details.</p><p>\"China\'s military modernization is consistent with its rapid economic growth,\" the Australian Department of Defense said. \"As with all countries, we encourage China to be transparent about its military capabilities and strategic intentions to provide greater assurance to its neighbors.\"</p><p>GROWING STOCKPILE</p><p>\"An armed Jin-class SSBN will give China an important strategic capability that must be countered,\" Admiral Harry Harris, then head of the U.S. Pacific Command, told a congressional committee last year.</p><p>That response appears to be happening. The United States and its allies are expanding their anti-submarine naval deployments across East Asia. This includes stepped-up patrols of America\'s advanced, sub-hunting P-8 Poseidon planes out of Singapore and Japan.</p><p>With its relatively small force of nuclear missiles, Beijing has always worried that it might be vulnerable to a debilitating first strike. These fears were magnified as Chinese military planners watched Washington employ precision-guided weapons in conflicts like the Gulf wars, Afghanistan, Syria and the Balkans.</p><p>As it strengthens and improves its nuclear arsenal, Beijing is the only major nuclear power to be adding warheads to its stockpiles. China is developing an air-launched ballistic missile and plans to build a long-range stealth bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons. With the sea-based second-strike deterrent in place, those programs suggest Beijing eventually intends to field a triad of air, sea and land-based nuclear weapons like the United States and Russia.</p><p>In the past two decades, the PLA Rocket Force, the service which controls China\'s nuclear and conventional missiles, has invested heavily in expanding its stockpile of nuclear warheads and boosted the range and accuracy of the missiles that deliver them. It has also hardened the protection of its silo-based nuclear weapons, according to reports in China\'s state-controlled media. The Pentagon and official Chinese military publications have reported that China has also deployed modern, road-mobile missiles that are more difficult for an adversary to find and attack.</p><p>Still, China lags far behind the United States and Russia in overall nuclear firepower. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that China has a total of 280 nuclear warheads. China does not disclose how many of its warheads are deployed and ready for conflict. The United States has 1,750 deployed warheads and Russia 1,600, the institute\'s 2018 report said. The United States and Russia each have thousands more warheads held in stockpiles, according to the report.</p><p>Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project of the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists, said he had yet to see hard intelligence suggesting China had placed fully armed ballistic missiles on its submarines at sea, despite the intense activity. Just because the submarines exist, he said, \"that doesn\'t mean that they have the weapons aboard the vessels.\"</p><p>While acknowledging that China has significantly enhanced its nuclear deterrence, the Pentagon isn\'t convinced that Chinese subs are yet conducting around-the-clock patrols. In a January report, the Pentagon\'s Defense Intelligence Agency said the Chinese navy would need a minimum of five Jin-class submarines to maintain a continuous nuclear deterrence at sea. China now has four.</p><p>UNDERSEA DUELS</p><p>A fleet of nuclear missile submarines hidden in the vast expanses of the ocean would help offset Beijing\'s nuclear shortcomings, say Chinese and Western strategists.</p><p>Chinese naval designers and nuclear technicians have been working to build a force of nuclear missile submarines since the late 1950s. A single vessel was launched in the 1980s, but it was never fully operational. This submarine served as a test bed as Chinese technicians and designers struggled to overcome problems with nuclear propulsion technology, missiles and excessive noise that would have made the vessels easier for an adversary to detect and target.</p><p>To maximize its second-strike capability, China\'s missile subs would need to be stealthy enough to go undetected as they sail to their patrol areas in the open ocean. U.S. and other foreign naval analysts say the Jin-class submarines are a sharp improvement over China\'s earlier efforts, but they remain less stealthy than their U.S., Russian, French and British counterparts.</p><p>The 11,000-tonne Jin-class submarines are stationed on the southern coast of China\'s Hainan Island, close to deep water channels leading into and out of the South China Sea. The geography of China\'s coastal waters has forced Beijing to base its missile submarines in this area, astride one of the world\'s most important shipping lanes.</p><p>In the north, the Yellow Sea is too shallow to conceal big, ballistic missile submarines. The East China Sea is deeper but it\'s confined by the Korean Peninsula, Japan\'s island chain and Taiwan.</p><p>And Japanese and U.S. forces can deploy advanced anti-submarine warfare ships and aircraft based in Japan to closely monitor these waters and the channels that pass out into the Western Pacific, where the submarines are ultimately headed. The Chinese need to reach these waters to be in a position to fire on the United States.</p><p>The South China Sea, by contrast, is much bigger and in parts deeper, making it more suitable for concealed submarine operations, according to Western submariners with extensive experience of patrolling in this area.</p><p>China would need to get its submarines out of Hainan, past surveillance and into seas east of the Philippines for their missiles to be in striking range of the United States. This is a key reason why China has gone to such lengths to reclaim and fortify islands and reefs in the South China Sea that are expanding Beijing\'s control over this area, according to Western submariners and military attaches.</p><p>The sub fleet\'s vulnerability to detection also explains China\'s extreme sensitivity to the surveillance operations of the United States and its allies in these waters. A Chinese destroyer sailed within 45 meters of the American destroyer USS Decatur in late September, as the American warship patrolled in the Spratlys, a highly contested island chain where China has expanded its foothold in recent years. It was the latest in a series of close encounters in the past decade.</p><p>China now appears to be on guard against foreign subs attempting to detect and shadow its ballistic missile fleet. As China\'s Jin-class vessels put to sea, they appear to be flanked by protective screens of surface warships and aircraft on station to track foreign submarines, according to military officers and analysts familiar with allied surveillance of the Chinese coast.</p><p>Serving and former senior naval officers also point to the extensive, frequent deployments of the Chinese navy\'s latest Type 056A corvettes into key waters south of Japan and east of the Philippines. The Type 056A is China\'s most advanced submarine hunter. It is able to tow sonar arrays and other listening equipment deep beneath the surface to detect enemy submarines – advanced technology that China did not have just five years ago.</p><p>China has also installed an array of sensors, antennas and satellite communications installations on islands in the Spratlys, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The PLA is tracking the foreign undersea hunters from the air, too. It has formed a squadron of Y-8GX6 aircraft on Hainan with the ability to comb vast areas of the sea surface for magnetic anomalies. The turboprop planes have already been seen landing on Woody Island, China\'s key offshore holding in the South China Sea. These patrols are not the infrequent exercises of the past, but now near-constant deployments, shadowing foreign warships as well.</p><p>\"We\'re looking at them looking for us,\" said one Western military attache.</p><p>FURTIVE FORCE</p><p>The submarine base near Sanya is now under direct control of the Central Military Commission, the top military decision-making body, chaired by Xi Jinping himself. The new communications installations in the South China Sea have helped knit together the new command structure, allowing tighter control from Beijing, right down to individual vessels.</p><p>In 2017, Beijing appointed a veteran submariner, Vice Admiral Yuan Yubai, to head the Southern Theater Command, which is responsible for the South China Sea. His promotion was a clear indication of the importance China attaches to supporting nuclear sub operations, according to Chinese naval experts. Yuan is the first naval officer to head a command of this type, a promotion that\'s part of a sweeping overhaul of the military structure by Xi Jinping.</p><p>Commercial satellite images of the submarine base give insight into the furtive force stationed there. They appear to show missile submarines regularly tied up alongside long piers in the harbor. Satellite images from Google Earth in June last year show what appear to be three Jin-class missile submarines at the base.</p><p>The vessels have a distinctive shape, with a hump-like structure that houses the missile tubes behind the sail, the vertical structure that rises from a submarine\'s hull. Clearly visible in the images: a partially submerged entrance to what appear to be underground submarine pens, beneath a hill next to the harbor.</p><p>Construction at the base near Sanya also points to the PLA\'s ability to stealthily arm submarine-launched missiles with nuclear warheads.</p><p>Western intelligence analysts familiar with satellite imagery of the area say a covered railway has been completed that runs into a hillside bunker – the suspected warhead arsenal. The railway in turn is linked by tunnels to the pens built for the submarines. This, they say, means the missiles can be armed and loaded on the submarines – without detection.</p><p>(GRAPHIC: How China is replacing America as Asia’s military titan - https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-xi/)</p><p>(GRAPHIC: New missile gap leaves U.S. scrambling to counter China - https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-rockets/)</p><p>(GRAPHIC: China’s vast fleet is tipping the balance in the Pacific - https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-navy/)</p><p> (Reporting Greg Torode and David Lague in Hong Kong.

最近前往中國南海岸海底島周圍海灣的遊客描述了一種奇怪的夜間現象。強大的聚光燈有時會在夜間直接在鄰近酒店的海濱進行訓練，因此幾乎不可能在海上進行觀察。有些燈安裝在陸地上，其他燈安裝在海軍巡邏艇上。 </p><p> “效果令人難以置信，”最近一位訪客說。 “眩光很大，你很難站在陽台上。你進去，拉緊窗簾。” </p><p>令人目眩的燈光無法掩蓋世界軍事情報機構的強烈興趣：有證據表明中國在與美國和俄羅斯作為核武器大國競爭中取得了突破。 </p><p>衛星圖像顯示，在三亞度假城附近的戰略基地定期出現核動力彈道導彈潛艇。專門用於保護潛艇的水面艦艇和專用水面艦艇是在海岸附近蜿蜒的主要水道。基地的設施似乎是為了儲存和裝載彈道導彈而建造的。支持尋找外國潛艇的天線陣列出現在激烈爭奪的南中國海的中國島嶼上。並且已經任命一名資深潛水艇在該國南部指揮中國軍隊。 </p><p>服務和退役的海軍軍官，外交官和安全分析師表示，這意味著中國擁有一支可以從海浪下發動核攻擊的導彈潛艇部隊，現在似乎正在巡邏。這給了北京一直到最近都缺乏的東西：如果陸基核武庫受到攻擊，它將具有更可靠的“二次打擊”能力。 </p><p>請參閱此處的交互式版本：https：//reut.rs/2ZO6ar9 </p><p>經過六十年的鬥爭，掌握複雜和具有挑戰性的海底軍事技術，中國已加入美國，俄羅斯，英國和法國的核彈道導彈潛艇俱樂部。五角大樓在8月份發布的最新中國軍事年度報告中，對中國能力的最明確評估表示，北京現在擁有“可靠”和“可行”的海基核威懾力量。 </p><p>一支有效的核彈道導彈潛艇艦隊，即所謂的彈道導彈核潛艇導彈，標誌著中國核能力的巨大提升。根據五角大樓的說法，中國四艘晉級潛艇中的每艘潛艇都配備了多達12枚彈道導彈，可攜帶核彈頭，估計射程為7,200公里（約4,500英里）。這將使美國與西太平洋相距甚遠。總部設在華盛頓的戰略與國際研究中心的分析人員估計，這些導彈可飛行至少8000公里。美國認為，中國擁有多達100枚基於陸地的核導彈。 </p><p>北京增強核能力是中國領導人習近平雄心勃勃地改造世界上最大的戰鬥部隊人民解放軍的標誌之一。西方戰略家說，中國的核潛艇艦隊加劇了這一挑戰，即日益強大的中國軍隊對美國在亞洲的統治地位構成了挑戰。 </p><p> “反對方永遠不能完全確定它知道所有潛艇的位置，”彼得霍羅賓說，他是退役的澳大利亞潛艇指揮官，也是冷戰戰鬥中發現和監視蘇聯潛艇的老兵。 </p><p>中國國防部，美國印度太平洋司令部和五角大樓沒有回答路透社提出的問題。 </p><p>目前尚不清楚中國是否正在部署全副武裝的潛艇以保持全天候的威懾力，正如其他彈道導彈潛艇的力量所做的那樣。一些分析人士懷疑中國已取得如此進展。 </p><p>但美國及其盟國表現得像中國一樣。西方軍方官員私下表示，在運作方面，美國及其盟國 - 包括日本，澳大利亞和英國 - 已經在試圖追踪中國導彈潛艇的行動，好像他們全副武裝，並進行威懾巡邏。 </p><p>當被問及他們在追踪中國潛艇方面的作用時，日本和英國表示不會對運營細節發表評論。 </p><p> “中國的軍事現代化與其快速的經濟增長是一致的，”澳大利亞國防部說。 “與所有國家一樣，我們鼓勵中國對其軍事能力和戰略意圖保持透明，以便為其鄰國提供更多保障。” </p><p>不斷增長的庫存</p><p>美國太平洋司令部司令哈里哈里斯海軍上將哈里哈里斯去年告訴國會委員會說：“武裝晉級的SSBN將給予中國一個必須應對的重要戰略能力。” </p><p>這種反應似乎正在發生。美國及其盟國正在擴大其在東亞的反潛海軍部署。這包括在新加坡和日本之外加強對美國先進的亞狩獵P-8 Poseidon飛機的巡邏。 </p><p>憑藉其相對較小的核導彈力量，北京一直擔心它可能容易受到衰弱的第一次打擊。隨著中國軍事策劃者看到華盛頓在海灣戰爭，阿富汗，敘利亞和巴爾乾等衝突中使用精確制導武器，這些擔憂被放大了。 </p><p>在加強和改善其核武庫的過程中，北京是唯一一個為其庫存增加彈頭的主要核電國。中國正在研製一種空射彈道導彈，併計劃建造一種能夠攜帶核武器的遠程隱形轟炸機。隨著海基二次打擊威懾力的到位，這些計劃表明，北京最終打算將美國和俄羅斯等空中，海上和陸地核武器三合一。 </p><p>在過去二十年中，控制中國核導彈和常規導彈的解放軍火箭部隊已經投入巨資擴大其核彈頭庫存，並提高了導彈的射程和射程的準確性。據中國官方媒體報導，它還加強了對基於筒倉的核武器的保護。五角大樓和中國官方軍事出版物報導說，中國還部署了現代的公路機動導彈，對手更難以發現和攻擊。 </p><p>儘管如此，中國在整體核火力方面遠遠落後於美國和俄羅斯。斯德哥爾摩國際和平研究所估計，中國共擁有280枚核彈頭。中國沒有透露有多少彈頭被部署並準備好迎接衝突。該研究所的2018年報告稱，美國有1,750枚部署彈頭，俄羅斯有1,600枚。據報導，美國和俄羅斯各有數千枚彈頭被儲存。 </p><p>總部設在華盛頓的美國科學家聯合會核信息項目主任漢斯克里斯滕森表示，儘管活動激烈，他還沒有看到中國在其海上潛艇上裝備全副武裝彈道導彈的情報。他說，僅僅因為潛艇存在，“這並不意味著它們擁有船上的武器。” </p><p>雖然五角大樓承認中國已顯著增強其核威懾力，但並不相信中國潛艇尚未進行全天候巡邏。在1月的一份報告中，五角大樓的國防情報局表示，中國海軍需要至少五艘金級潛艇才能在海上維持持續的核威懾。中國現在有四個。 </p><p> UNDERSEA DUELS </p><p>中國和西方戰略家表示，隱藏在廣闊海洋中的一隊核導彈潛艇將有助於抵消北京的核缺陷。 </p><p>自20世紀50年代末以來，中國海軍設計師和核技術人員一直致力於建立核導彈潛艇部隊。一艘船在20世紀80年代發射升空，但從未完全投入使用。由於中國技術人員和設計師努力克服核推進技術，導彈和過度噪音的問題，這艘潛艇成為試驗台，這將使船隻更容易被對手探測和瞄準。 </p><p>為了最大限度地提高其二次打擊能力，中國的導彈潛艇必須足夠隱蔽，以便在他們駛向公海的巡邏區時不被發現。美國和其他外國海軍分析人士稱，金級潛艇比中國早期的努力有了明顯的改善，但它們的隱身性仍然低於美國，俄羅斯，法國和英國的潛艇。 </p><p> 11,000噸級的金級潛艇駐紮在中國海南島的南部海岸，靠近通往南海的深水通道。中國沿海水域的地理位置迫使北京將其導彈潛艇建在該地區，跨越世界上最重要的航道之一。 </p><p>在北方，黃海太淺，無法隱藏大型彈道導彈潛艇。東海更深，但它受到朝鮮半島，日本島鍊和台灣的限制。 </p><p>日本和美國部隊可以在日本部署先進的反潛戰艦和飛機，密切監視這些水域和通往西太平洋的航道，這些潛艇最終將在這裡潛水。中國需要到達這些水域才能對美國開火。 </p><p>相比之下，南中國海更大，部分更深，使其更適合隱蔽的潛艇作戰，據具有豐富巡邏經驗的西方潛艇艇員說。 </p><p>中國將需要將其潛艇從海南撤出，經過監視並進入菲律賓以東的海域，因為它們的導彈位於美國的驚人范圍內。根據西方潛艇艇員和軍方的說法，這是中國在南中國海開墾和加固島嶼和珊瑚礁的關鍵原因，這些島嶼正在擴大北京對這一地區的控制。 </p><p>次級艦隊的易受檢測也解釋了中國對美國及其在這些海域的盟友的監視行動的極端敏感性。 9月下旬，一艘中國驅逐艦在距離美國驅逐艦美國戰艦Deatur 45米的範圍內航行，當時美國軍艦在南沙群島巡邏，這是一個競爭激烈的島嶼鏈，近年來中國已擴大其立足點。這是過去十年中一系列親密接觸中的最新一次。 </p><p>中國現在似乎在防範外國潛艇試圖偵察和遮擋其彈道導彈艦隊。據熟悉中國海岸盟軍監視的軍官和分析人員說，隨著中國的金級艦艇出海，他們看起來側面都是水面艦艇和飛機上的保護屏，以跟踪外國潛艇。 </p><p>服役和前高級海軍軍官還指出，中國海軍最新的056A型輕型護衛艦在日本南部和菲律賓以東的主要水域進行了廣泛，頻繁的部署。 056A型是中國最先進的潛艇獵人。它能夠在地表深處牽引聲納陣列和其他聽力設備來探測敵方潛艇 - 這是中國五年前沒有的先進技術。 </p><p>根據國際戰略研究所的數據，中國還在南沙群島的島嶼上安裝了一系列傳感器，天線和衛星通信裝置。解放軍正在從空中追踪外國海底獵人。它在海南組建了一個Y-8GX6型飛機中隊，能夠在海面的大面積區域內進行磁異常。已經看到渦輪螺旋槳飛機降落在中國在南海的主要海上控股木質島。這些巡邏不是過去罕見的演習，而是現在幾乎不間斷的部署，也影響了外國戰艦。 </p><p> “我們正在尋找他們尋找我們，”一名西方軍方武官說。 </p><p>頑強的力量</p><p>三亞附近的潛艇基地現在由中央軍事委員會直接控制，中央軍事委員會是由習近平本人擔任主席的最高軍事決策機構。南中國海的新通信裝置有助於將新的指揮結構整合在一起，從而使北京更加嚴格地控制著各個船隻。 </p><p> 2017年，北京任命一位資深潛艇艇員，海軍上將袁玉白，領導負責南中國海的南方戰區司令部。據中國海軍專家稱，他的晉升清楚地表明了中國重視支持核子作戰的重要性。袁是第一位領導這種指揮的海軍軍官，這是習近平對軍事結構進行徹底改革的一部分。 </p><p>潛艇基地的商業衛星圖像可以深入了解駐紮在那裡的武裝力量。他們似乎表明導彈潛艇經常與港口的長墩並列。去年6月來自谷歌地球的衛星圖像顯示了基地的三艘金級導彈潛艇。 </p><p>這些船隻具有獨特的形狀，具有類似駝峰的結構，其中包含帆後面的導彈管，垂直結構從潛艇的船體上升起。在圖像中清晰可見：在港口旁邊的一座小山下面，似乎是地下潛水筆的部分淹沒入口。 </p><p>三亞附近基地的建設也表明解放軍有能力悄悄地裝備帶有核彈頭的潛射導彈。 </p><p>熟悉該地區衛星圖像的西方情報分析人員表示，已經完成了一條覆蓋的鐵路，這條鐵路遇到了一個山坡掩體 - 可疑的彈頭武器庫。鐵路反過來通過隧道連接到為潛艇建造的鋼筆。他們說，這意味著導彈可以裝備在潛艇上 - 無需檢測。 </p><p> （圖表：中國如何取代美國成為亞洲的軍事巨頭 -  https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-xi/） </p><p> （圖解：新的導彈差距讓美國爭先恐後地反擊中國 -  https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-rockets/） </p><p> （圖表：中國龐大的船隊正在推動太平洋地區的平衡 -

Tony Evers for the first time on Thursday, a day after Gou recommitted to a massive project in the state following a White House meeting with President Donald Trump.</p><p>Questions about Foxconn’s commitment to the Wisconsin project have swirled for months, but Gou and the project’s backers tried to put those to rest.

Foxconn failed to meet its job targets last year to qualify for tax credits in Wisconsin and has downsized the type of factory it intends to build.</p><p>Evers, a Democrat, has said Foxconn wants to make changes to its contract with the state, which has promised to make more than $4 billion available in state and local tax credits if Foxconn spends about $9 billion and hires 13,000 people.</p><p>Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, whose district includes the project site, said he hoped Gou’s comments and meetings would convince skeptics.</p><p>“Perhaps today Gov. Evers has accepted the fact that Gov. Walker and Republicans negotiated a really good deal for the state of Wisconsin and perhaps hearing it directly from chairman Gou’s own mouth he can accept the reality that Foxconn is going to be a huge benefit for our state and we should all celebrate it,” Vos said.</p><p>Evers was joined at the meeting with Gou by the state’s chief economic development official who brokered the original Foxconn deal. Gou was also met separately with local leaders in southeast Wisconsin, including Vos.</p><p>Gou told reporters after his meeting with Trump that the company remained committed to Wisconsin.</p><p>“It is not right to say our investment in Wisconsin has changed,” Gou said in a video broadcast by Taiwan media as reported by Nikkei Asian Review. “We suspended the work around October, November last year because the weather there was snowy and icy cold. We will continue our work in May when the weather gets warmer.”</p><p>Preliminary data from the National Weather Service shows the average high in Racine County, where the project is located, in October was 54 degrees and 39 degrees in November. The average low was 41 in October and 27 in November. There was no snowfall in October and 6.7 inches in November.</p><p>One of the other items discussed, according to Kyodo News, was Gou’s plans announced last month to run for president of Taiwan.</p><p>Gou, Taiwan’s richest man, told Trump that if elected, he intends to be a “peace maker” rather than a “trouble maker,” Kyodo News reported. Gou also told Trump that he would commit himself to advancing peace and stability and improving Taiwan’s economy. Gou told Trump that he wanted to strengthen economic ties between Taiwan and the United States and make their economic relations a top priority.</p><p>Sanders said Trump did not discuss support for Gou’s campaign in their meeting.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

He is Taiwan’s richest man, with an estimated fortune of $7bn, so he should have no trouble funding the campaign for president he announced last week. What is more, few people in the world could claim to have created more jobs: starting with a tiny loan from his mother, he built the biggest contract-manufacturing company in the electronics business, Foxconn, which makes iPhones for Apple, among other things. It employs close to 1m people. Given voters’ frustration at the wan performance of the economy under the incumbent, Tsai Ing-wen, it is easy to see how Mr Gou might sell himself as the answer to their prayers.</p><p>But it is impossible to build such a big business without piling up liabilities, in a political sense, at least. Mr Gou has no shortage. For one thing, the jobs he has created are not in Taiwan, for the most part. And nine years ago Foxconn was hit by a spate of suicides among its workers, prompting many to ask whether it should be treating them better. In fact, Foxconn’s model is the opposite of what Taiwan needs, argues Hsiao Bi-khim, an MP for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party or DPP (Mr Gou is seeking the nomination of the biggest opposition party, the Kuomintang or KMT). It has flourished by cold-shouldering Taiwanese workers, and building factories in places with lower wages instead, she points out, especially China. At the heart of Taiwan’s economic problems, she contends, are stagnant incomes—a problem for which Foxconn serves more as a cautionary tale than an inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>But questions about Foxconn’s qualities as an employer pale next to the worries Mr Gou’s candidacy prompts about conflicts of interest. China considers Taiwan part of its territory, and asserts its right to bring about reunification by force if necessary. How on earth, many Taiwanese ask, could Mr Gou be counted on to stand up to China when so many of Foxconn’s factories are on the mainland, leaving his personal fortune dependent on the goodwill of the Chinese Communist Party? “China has him by the neck,” the anchor of a popular television chat show observed this week.</p><p>Then again, China has the rest of Taiwan by the neck, too. Around 1m Taiwanese, about a tenth of the labour force, work in China. Together with Hong Kong, China hoovers up about 40% of Taiwan’s exports. China rewards emollient Taiwanese governments with economic fillips such as a boom in tourism from the mainland, and punishes standoffish ones by taking them away. The KMT has responded to this system by not formally renouncing the goal of reunification and by seeking to strengthen economic ties. The DPP, in contrast, stresses that Taiwan is an independent country like any other, despite the economic retribution such talk brings. Voters have to choose, in essence, between economic benefits that put the country even more at China’s mercy, or foreign-policy-induced austerity.</p><p>Mr Gou’s candidacy simply presents a more acute version of this dilemma. Shortly after he joined the race, Ms Tsai took a swipe at him on social media for saying, in response to anti-China protests a couple of years ago, “You cannot eat democracy.” Mr Gou lashed out, saying Ms Tsai had taken the quote out of context because she was either “really stupid and really naive” or “really malicious and really wilful”. All he had meant, he insisted, was that democracy should be used to improve people’s lives.</p><p>Mr Gou’s fury at Ms Tsai’s gibe suggests that he knows it would be political suicide to be seen as advocating the trade-off that China is so clearly offering, of greater prosperity at the expense of independence. Bruce Jacobs of Monash University in Australia argues that Taiwan has, in effect, a built-in DPP majority, and that KMT candidates have to find ways to broaden their appeal beyond the party’s base to get elected.</p><p>Mr Gou’s answer to this conundrum seems to be to present himself as a sort of ordinary-Joe-made-good. He took a break from bickering with Ms Tsai this week to push his elderly mother around a park in a wheelchair in front of the TV cameras. And he announced his candidacy at a temple dedicated to Matsu, a goddess widely revered in Taiwan and coastal China. Matsu, he said, had come to him in a dream and told him to run to help “those who are struggling”. It will be hard, however, for Mr Gou to pass himself off as the salt of the earth. “It is not appropriate to politicise Matsu,” an elderly devotee declares tartly.</p>',NULL,'https://d37273sceiavoe.cloudfront.net/news/economist/1557043408627','[\"135\", \"377\", \"255\"]',2,'台灣最富有的人說他競選總統是神聖的啟發','其他人擔心他推進的偉大計劃是中國的','事實上，富士康的模式與台灣需要的模式正好相反，執政的民進黨或民進黨的議員蕭碧金認為（郭台銘正在尋求最大的反對黨，國民黨或國民黨的提名）。','<p>如果RICH BUSINESSMEN為政治帶來優勢和責任，那麼Terry Gou將他們帶入了黑桃。他是台灣最富有的人，估計有70億美元的財富，所以他應該毫不費力地為上周宣布的總統競選提供資金。更重要的是，世界上很少有人可以聲稱創造了更多就業機會：從他母親的小額貸款開始，他建立了電子行業最大的合同製造公司，富士康，為蘋果製造iPhone，以及其他東西。 。它僱用了近100萬人。鑑於選民對現任經營者蔡英文的經濟表現感到沮喪，很容易看出郭台銘如何將自己作為他們祈禱的答案。 </p><p>但至少在政治意義上，如果不積累債務，就不可能建立這樣一個大企業。郭先生並不缺乏。首先，他創造的工作大部分都不在台灣。九年前，富士康在其工人中遭遇了一連串的自殺事件，促使許多人質疑是否應該更好地對待他們。事實上，富士康的模式與台灣需要的模式正好相反，執政的民進黨或民進黨的議員蕭碧金認為（郭台銘正在尋求最大的反對黨，國民黨或國民黨的提名）。她指出，特別是中國，它在冷落的台灣工人中蓬勃發展，在工資較低的地方建廠。她認為，台灣經濟問題的核心是收入停滯不前 - 富士康作為一個警示故事而不是靈感來解決這個問題。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>但是，關於富士康作為雇主的品質的問題在郭台銘的候選人擔憂引發利益衝突的旁邊顯得蒼白無力。中國認為台灣是其領土的一部分，並聲稱有必要在必要時以武力實現統一。許多台灣人問道，當富士康的許多工廠都在大陸工作時，他的個人財產是否依賴於中國共產黨的善意，郭台銘是否可以指望他站在中國面前？本週觀看了一場受歡迎的電視聊天節目的主播，“中國讓他受到了影響”。 </p><p>再說一次，中國也有其他台灣。約有100萬台灣人，約佔勞動力的十分之一，在中國工作。與中國香港一起，中國大約佔台灣出口的40％。中國向台灣的政府提供經濟補救措施，例如大陸旅遊業的蓬勃發展，並通過將其帶走來懲罰冷漠的台灣政府。國民黨通過不正式放棄統一的目標和尋求加強經濟聯繫來回應這一制度。相比之下，民進黨強調台灣是一個獨立的國家，儘管這種言論帶來了經濟報復。從本質上講，選民必須選擇使國家更加受中國憐憫的經濟利益或外交政策引發的緊縮政策。 </p><p>郭台銘的候選資格只是提出了這種兩難困境的更為嚴厲的版本。在他參加比賽后不久，蔡女士在社交媒體上猛烈抨擊他說，回應幾年前的反華抗議活動，“你不能吃民主。”郭台銘猛烈抨擊，說蔡女士已經採取了脫離背景的引用，因為她要么“真的很愚蠢，真的很天真”或“真的很惡意，真的很任性”。他堅持認為，所有他的意思都是民主應該被用來改善人們的生活。 </p><p>郭台銘對蔡女士的嫉妒表示憤怒，這表明他知道將中國如此明確地提供權衡，以犧牲獨立為代價來實現更大的繁榮，這將是政治上的自殺。澳大利亞莫納什大學的布魯斯雅各布斯認為，台灣實際上已經建立了民進黨的多數席位，國民黨候選人必須想方設法擴大他們的吸引力，超越黨的基礎才能當選。 </p><p>郭台銘對這個難題的回答似乎是將自己表現為一種普通的喬製造的善。他本週與蔡女士爭吵，讓他年邁的母親在電視攝像機前坐在輪椅上的公園裡休息。他宣布了他在一個致力於媽祖的神廟中的候選資格，媽祖是台灣和中國沿海地區廣受尊敬的女神。他說，媽祖在夢中來到他面前，並告訴他要幫助“那些正在掙扎的人”。然而，苟先生很難將自己當作地球的鹽。 “將媽祖政治化是不恰當的，”一位年長的奉獻者尖刻地宣稱。 </p>'),(325,4,'https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/07/19/taiwans-long-relationship-with-paraguay-continues-to-pay-off','Taiwan’s long relationship with Paraguay continues to pay off','Landlocked Paraguay is the last South American country that still recognises Taiwan','Unveiled in 2017 to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties, it is entwined with the national flowers of Taiwan (plum blossoms) and Paraguay (passion flowers).','','2018-07-19T14:55:41Z',1532012141000,'<p>NO PLACE on Earth is farther from Paraguay than Taiwan, its antipode.

Mario Abdo Benítez, Paraguay’s president-elect, hopes to sign a trade deal with China via Mercosur, a trade bloc. According to an adviser, he wants to open a trade-and-investment office in Beijing without granting recognition. As one minister has acknowledged, Paraguay already exports goods to China indirectly—mainly soyabeans sold onwards from Uruguay.</p><p>But Taiwan is unflustered, says Diego Chou, its ambassador to Paraguay. Non-recognition is no barrier to trade with the People’s Republic, he notes: China is Taiwan’s principal trade partner.

But he adds that \"the manner in which they did that has been, and will continue to be, highly disruptive to international oil markets and to the bilateral relationships with Iran\'s main oil importers,\" he added.  </p><p>The potential disruption to oil markets may end up contributing to the difficulty of cutting Iran\'s exports. </p><p>Production within the OPEC oil cartel has been disrupted by US sanctions on Venezuela, intensifying conflict inside Libya, and a Saudi decision to cut production, analysts said. </p><p>Rosenberg said oil market realities are another reason it will be hard to eliminate Iranian oil exports. \"I don\'t expect it will get to zero, there aren\'t enough supplies. ... There was not enough notice,\" said Rosenberg. \"The Saudis don\'t have enough, that is not happening.\"</p><p>Oil prices are an additional wild card, as a slew of factors are already driving domestic US gasoline prices higher -- a \"red line\" for Trump, the Eurasia Group notes -- just as Americans start the summer holiday driving season.</p><p> </p><p>And then there\'s the question of whether importing countries will cooperate or try to defy Washington. </p><p>\"We expect South Korea and Japan to comply fully, to zero out,\" said Rome. </p><p>\"We expect China and India to more or less comply\" -- but not entirely, Rome added.  </p><p>\"The big difference is we expect both countries to continue importing small volumes of Iranian crude, about 300,000 barrels per day between the two of them,\" Rome said. \"By and large, these countries are more complying than they are defying, but they still do not want to lose face on this and they\'re sufficiently incentivized to come up with ways to get around this.\"</p><p>Both China and India have made substantial investments in Iran and the arrangement is that they get paid in oil, Rome said, predicting that both countries could argue that their continued acceptance of Iranian oil amounts to Tehran\'s repayment of a debt and not a contribution to Iran\'s coffers. </p><p>Some countries have made clear they may resist.

The tech sector overall is wrestling with a slowdown. And a trade war between China and the U.S. puts Foxconn directly in the crossfire. </p><p>Flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported earnings late Tuesday. The maker of Apple Inc. iPhones posted operating income that didn’t even match the lowest of analyst estimates, dropping 35% from a year earlier. That’s the biggest miss for a March quarter since Hon Hai started reporting consolidated numbers 11 years ago.</p><p>The results were bad across the board. Gross margin was the lowest in seven years, and operating margin fell near historic lows. Judging by the stock’s drop Wednesday morning, investors didn’t see this coming any more than analysts.</p><p>Gou loves to talk. He is happy to chat about his trip to the White House and meeting President Donald Trump. He loves to ponder what Taiwan needs from a president. He is keen to share his twin passions of charity and cancer research. But what he doesn’t like to discuss are the inner workings of his own $34 billion business.</p><p>In situations like this, a CEO should be on a conference call explaining the situation to investors. Executives would do the rounds of financial media to calm shareholders. Yet Gou isn’t doing that. Hon Hai’s investor relations team offers the scantest of information in a single earnings table sent from a Gmail account.</p><p>Which leaves investors in the dark about what went wrong last quarter. Last month I noted that Foxconn took one for team Apple in the December quarter by carrying excess inventory despite slowing sales. Data released Tuesday for the March period suggest this is exactly what happened, pointing to an inventory writedown as a reason for the 202 basis point drop in operating margin from the prior quarter.</p><p>In recent months Gou has said he’s barely running the company and will hand over to a successor soon. That nobody knows who the new leader will be says a lot about Gou and his leadership. As soon as a name pops up in local media reports, that person appears to get crossed off the list. </p><p>Investors deserve better. Gou should be implementing strategies to cope with the downturn and communicating them across his sprawling empire. Instead, he’s off chasing a political career, which is starting to look like a vanity project. </p><p>If Gou has truly stepped back, as his public statements indicate, he has yet to fulfill a fundamental obligation to shareholders: planning and communicating an orderly transfer of responsibility. By contrast, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. founder Morris Chang groomed two possible successors for years in the public eye, before announcing the next generation of leadership eight months ahead of his retirement. </p><p>In one of his most recent campaign statements, Gou wrote that “politics must serve the economy.” Foxconn shareholders must be left wondering who will serve them.</p><p>To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.net</p><p>This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p><p>Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Davis','1557596285000',1557596285000,'<p>Fights broke out Saturday in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong as lawmakers debated an extradition measure that would allow transfer of criminal offenders to face charges in mainland China.</p><p>On its face, the proposed amendment to Hong Kong’s Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance would allow ad hoc extradition to any jurisdiction where Hong Kong lacks an extradition agreement, something the government claims is routine practice. Hong Kong has mutual extradition agreements with 20 jurisdictions and provides legal assistance to 32 others.</p><p>However, local and foreign rights lawyers are concerned the measure would include extradition to mainland China. Legal experts speculate Beijing hopes to open the door to extradite corrupt Chinese officials who flee to Hong Kong, as well as perhaps catch local activists in the dragnet.</p><p>In arguing for the measure, the government has cited the recent case of Tong-Kai Chan, who fled to Hong Kong after killing his girlfriend in Taiwan over an alleged affair, and could go free if not extradited to Taiwan. But it’s not clear why this one case would justify the drastic overhaul.</p><p>The Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council, however, has indicated that Taiwan would not accept transfer of Chan to Taiwan under this legislation because of the wider risk of extradition to the mainland for its citizens in Hong Kong.</p><p>[There’s a new chapter in Hong Kong’s struggle for democracy and autonomy]</p><p>In a complex legislative maneuver, to ensure the measure passes, the pro-Beijing majority in the Hong Kong council usurped the authority of the pan-democratic member presiding over the bills committee. This maneuver and the pro-establishment effort to ram the bill through set the stage for Saturday’s brawl.</p><p>The bill raises a number of concerns:</p><p>1. The bill undercuts the protection of Hong Kong’s rule of law </p><p>The “one country, two systems” framework for Hong Kong’s return to China in June 1997 recognized that these two legal systems have a huge gap in protection of human rights and the rule of law. Beijing guaranteed Hong Kong would have a high degree of autonomy — including human rights and rule of law protections that do not exist in Chinese laws. The only mainland laws that apply in Hong Kong are a handful of laws added to Annex III of the Hong Kong Basic Law addressing issues such as national symbols, nationality, diplomacy and sea boundaries.</p><p>These legal gaps remain largely in place two decades later, and the two governments thus far have failed to reach an extradition agreement. The mainland system often ignores human rights and the rule of law and includes a number of laws that restrict basic freedoms. Global rankings for freedom and the rule of law demonstrate the difference: Hong Kong ranked 16 and China 82 out of 116 countries on rule of law, for instance.</p><p>The nonpartisan legal adviser to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, a career government servant, has taken the unusual step of openly raising these concerns. In his view, extradition to the mainland should require a special agreement that more clearly addresses Hong Kong concerns with basic freedoms and due process of law.</p><p>[20 years ago, China promised Hong Kong ‘1 country, 2 systems.’ So much for promises.]</p><p>2. The proposed bill fails to exclude the extradition of Hong Kong residents to mainland China</p><p>A prominent member of Beijing’s Basic Law Committee, professor Albert Chen of the University of Hong Kong, points out that most jurisdictions under extradition agreements typically do not extradite their own citizens. The possibility of extradition to the mainland especially worries many Hong Kong residents.</p><p>The extradition proposal has already caused one local resident at risk to flee Hong Kong. In late 2015, bookseller Wing-Kee Lam was arrested while visiting neighboring Shenzhen, China. Months later, Chinese officials sent him back to Hong Kong, ostensibly to collect evidence. But Lam refused to return to the mainland. He recently moved to Taiwan, claiming it would no longer be safe for him in Hong Kong.</p><p>3. The Hong Kong government has failed to defend the territory’s autonomy</p><p>The government claims that the chief executive would serve as a gatekeeper to review requests for extradition to the mainland. But the Beijing-friendly Election Committee chooses Hong Kong’s chief executive, making the person in this role vulnerable to pressure from Beijing. In 2005, when Beijing disapproved the performance of Hong Kong’s first chief executive after the handover, he effectively had to resign. To many in Hong Kong, the Beijing liaison office in the Western district has undue influence on what goes on in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Hong Kong government has argued that it would allow extradition only in cases where the individual’s basic human rights were protected, and the decision would be subject to judicial review. Chen, however, noted that this puts Hong Kong courts “in a difficult and invidious position.” One worry, perhaps, is that the court may come under simultaneous pressure in the same case from Beijing and the Hong Kong government.</p><p>Despite its commitment to defend the autonomy promised under the “one country, two systems” framework, the Hong Kong government has a history of enabling interference from Beijing. In other recent cases, the Hong Kong government has prosecuted protesters, expelled pro-democracy legislators and banned political parties — actions many in Hong Kong see as moves on Beijing’s behalf.</p><p>This bill has also generated much international concern. Foreign governments have recognized Hong Kong as a separate territory for customs and trade since 1997, distinct from mainland China. The U.S. provides for such recognition under Hong Kong Policy Act, for instance. The recent U.S. State Department report on human rights in Hong Kong raised concerns about the erosion of basic freedoms.</p><p>The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission also weighed in recently to argue that “The extradition bill could pose significant risk to U.S. national security and economic interests in the territory,” allowing “Beijing to pressure the Hong Kong government to extradite U.S. citizens under false pretenses.” The same Commission in its 2018 report had worried that Beijing interference had endangered autonomy, calling Hong Kong’s distinct trading status into question.</p><p>In a recent press interview, the U.S. consul general in Hong Kong suggested that this extradition legislation will only intensify U.S. doubts about the continued viability of Hong Kong’s special status under the Hong Kong Policy Act.</p><p>Don’t miss anything!

On Friday, one week before the court-mandated deadline, lawmakers will vote on three draft bills, one put forward by the cabinet, two submitted by anti-LGBT groups.</p><p>For the people at the forefront of the marriage equality movement, it is a make-or-break moment, and success is anything but guaranteed.</p><p>Lawyer Victoria Hsu is the founder and executive director of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights. Her team represented LGBT pioneer Chi Chia-wei in the lawsuit that led to the constitutional court’s landmark ruling two years ago.</p><p>The court’s ruling allowed the legislature some discretionary leeway, Hsu said, giving it room to amend the civil code or add a new law specifically for same-sex couples. Taiwan’s LGBT community overwhelmingly prefers an amended civil code, while viewing a separate law as being intrinsically unequal.</p><p>The bill submitted to the Legislative Yuan by president Tsai Ing-wen’s cabinet would create a separate law, however, it is far more preferable to the other two bills, she said, which use the language of “same-sex union” or “same-sex family” instead of the word “marriage”.</p><p>“We hope the Legislative Yuan can pass the cabinet’s bill,” Hsu said. “Even though it’s not perfect, it’s still marriage.”</p><p>Opponents of LGBT rights in Taiwan, many of them conservative Christians, have been emboldened by last November’s referendum, in which same-sex marriage was rejected by voters. The constitutional court’s decision, on the matter, Hsu said, carried more legal weight than the referendum result.</p><p>In the local elections that were held concurrently with the referendum last year, there was a bright spot for the LGBT community here, however. Miao Po-ya, of the Social Democratic party was voted into office as a Taipei city councillor, making history as the first two openly gay people, both elected on the same day to hold such a position in Taiwan.</p><p>She said the cabinet’s draft law was the only one of the three up for consideration that could satisfy the constitutional court’s ruling. While there is significant support for it among legislators, she said it was not guaranteed to pass.</p><p>“Things are quite tense now,” she said.</p><p>Failure to pass the cabinet’s bill would be a major political setback for Tsai’s Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which holds a majority in the Legislative Yuan, Miao said. In the wake of the constitutional court ruling two years ago, the party could have easily pushed for full marriage equality legislation, with the cover of following court orders. Political considerations, including fear of retribution from conservative groups, led to inertia.</p><p>“Two years ago was an excellent opportunity” for the DPP, she said. “Now is their last chance to make this happen.”</p><p>Partisan politics aside, Taiwan’s image as one of Asia’s most progressive countries will also suffer if the cabinet’s bill fails to pass on Friday.</p><p>“People already have the impression that Taiwan will have same-sex marriage,” Miao said. If either of the anti-LGBT groups’ bills pass tomorrow, “the world will wonder what happened”, she said.</p><p>Jay Lin, organiser of the Taiwan International Queer Film Festival, said that while the cabinet’s bill wasn’t the ideal version of full marriage equality with full adoption rights, it was a start.</p><p>“I think it’s the best that we are able to get at this stage,” said Lin, who is father to two sons with his husband, who he married abroad. “We are coming down to the home stretch, and given the alternative, we must come together one final time to ensure the cabinet’s marriage bill passes.”</p><p>The cabinet’s bill is the only one of the three that allows for adoption rights for same-sex couples, Hsu said, but permitting only one partner to adopt the other’s biological children.</p><p>“It’s like not allowing a step-parent in a straight marriage to ever be allowed to adopt their spouse’s children,” Lin said.</p><p>Jennifer Lu, coordinator of the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan, said that even though the best-case scenario tomorrow – passage of the cabinet’s bill – was still not ideal, Taiwan was making quick progress with regard to same-sex marriage.</p><p>“We’ve seen other countries go through this process, and it can take 10 to 20 years, but we’re trying to do it in three,” she said. “I’m happy to see the government show leadership with this bill.”</p><p>Lu said she felt that if the bill passed, much of the conservative opposition to same-sex marriage here would likely abate. “In every country, marriage equality has been a big fight,” she said. “But after it passes, people realise it’s not a big deal.”</p><p>Should the cabinet bill pass, Lu said, it won’t be the end of the LGBT community’s fight for full marriage equality and adoption rights.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to the day our fight is over,” she said. “The last three years have been exhausting.”</p>',NULL,'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c0e4766a39bc621b84d728eaabbde5637f43b9/0_60_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4bd73e7fababd62a26d983e57df2977','[\"318\", \"309\", \"338\"]',0,'\n“情況非常緊張”：台灣同性婚姻投票迫在眉睫\n','\n\n在關於婚姻平等法案的議會辯論之前，支持者感到不安\n','台灣婚姻平等聯盟協調員Jennifer Lu表示，儘管明天的最佳案例 - 通過內閣法案 - 仍然不理想，台灣在同性婚姻方面取得了快速進展。','<p>兩年前，台灣憲法法院作出了一項歷史性的裁決，宣布該國的民法典，該法案認為婚姻只能在男女之間，違憲。 </p><p>法院給了台灣立法機構兩年的時間，通過一項法律承認同性婚姻的法律，否則他們將自動成為合法的。週五，在法院規定的截止日期前一周，立法者將對三項法案草案進行投票，其中一項由內閣提出，兩項由反LGBT團體提交。 </p><p>對於處於婚姻平等運動最前沿的人來說，這是一個成敗的時刻，成功只是保證。 </p><p> Victoria Hsu律師是台灣促進民事合夥權利聯盟的創始人兼執行董事。她的團隊在兩年前導致憲法法院具有里程碑意義的裁決的訴訟中代表LGBT先驅Chi Chia-wei。 </p><p> Hsu說，法院的裁決允許立法機構有一些酌情餘地，給予其修改民法的空間，或者為同性伴侶增加一項新的法律。台灣的LGBT社區絕大多數都喜歡修改後的民法典，同時將單獨的法律視為本質上不平等。 </p><p>由蔡英文總統內閣提交立法院的法案將製定一項單獨的法律，但是，與其他兩項法案相比，它更為可取，她說使用“同性聯盟”或“同一種語言” -sex家族“而不是”婚姻“這個詞。 </p><p> “我們希望立法院可以通過內閣的法案，”許說。 “即使它不完美，它仍然是婚姻。” </p><p>台灣的LGBT權利的反對者，其中許多是保守的基督徒，在去年11月的公民投票中更加膽大妄為，同性婚姻遭到選民的拒絕。 Hsu說，憲法法院關於此事的決定比公投結果更具法律意義。 </p><p>在去年與公投同時舉行的地方選舉中，這裡的LGBT社區有一個亮點。社會民主黨的苗寶雅被選為台北市議員，成為前兩位公開同性戀者的歷史，他們都是在同一天當選為在台灣擔任此職位的人。 </p><p>她說，內閣的法律草案是三個可以滿足憲法法院裁決的審議中唯一的一個。雖然立法者對此有很大的支持，但她表示不能保證會通過。 </p><p> “現在情況非常緊張，”她說。 </p><p>苗族說，未能通過內閣法案將是蔡氏民主進步黨（DPP）的重大政治挫折，民進黨在立法院佔多數。在兩年前憲法法院裁決之後，該黨可以輕易推動完全婚姻平等立法，並遵循法院命令。政治方面的考慮，包括對保守派團體報復的恐懼，導致了慣性。 </p><p>她說，“兩年前對民進黨來說是個絕佳機會”。 “現在是他們實現這一目標的最後機會。” </p><p>除了黨派政治外，台灣作為亞洲最發達國家之一的形象，如果內閣的法案未能在周五通過，也會受到影響。 </p><p> “人們已經認為台灣將有同性婚姻，”苗說。她說，如果任何一個反LGBT群體的法案明天通過，“世界將會想知道發生了什麼”。 </p><p>台灣國際酷兒電影節的組織者Jay Lin表示，雖然內閣的法案並不是完全採用權的全面婚姻平等的理想版本，但它是一個開始。 </p><p> “我認為這是我們能夠在這個階段獲得的最好成績，”林先生說，他是兩個兒子的父親，他的丈夫是他在國外結婚的。 “我們正在走向主場，如果有替代方案，我們必須最後一次聚集在一起，以確保內閣的婚姻法案獲得通過。” </p><p> Hsu說，內閣的法案是允許同性伴侶領養權的三個議案中的唯一一個，但只允許一個伴侶收養對方的親生子女。 </p><p> “這就像是不允許直接婚姻中的繼父母被允許領養他們的配偶子女，”林說。 </p><p>台灣婚姻平等聯盟協調員Jennifer Lu表示，儘管明天的最佳案例 - 通過內閣法案 - 仍然不理想，台灣在同性婚姻方面取得了快速進展。 </p><p> “我們已經看到其他國家經歷了這個過程，可能需要10到20年，但我們試圖在三個方面做到這一點，”她說。 “我很高興看到政府在這項法案中表現出領導力。” </p><p>盧說她覺得，如果法案通過，那麼保守派反對同性婚姻的大部分都可能會減弱。 “在每個國家，婚姻平等都是一場大戰，”她說。 “但在它過去之後，人們意識到這並不是什麼大問題。” </p><p>盧說，如果內閣法案獲得通過，那麼LGBT社區爭取完全婚姻平等和領養權的鬥爭將不會結束。 </p><p> “我很期待戰鬥結束的那一天，”她說。 “過去三年令人筋疲力盡。” </p>'),(355,8,'https://qz.com/1612510/money-mama-huang-chiu-lian-tipped-to-succeed-terry-gou-at-foxconn/','A woman known as “Money Mama” could succeed Terry Gou at Foxconn','null','According to Taiwanese media (link in Chinese), she is one of the founders of Foxconn—also known as Hon Hai—having provided startup capital for Gou to launch the company in 1974, and has held the keys to the company’s safe from the very beginning.','Mary Hui','2019-05-07T07:24:35.000Z',1557213875000,'<p>Ever since Foxconn chairman Terry Gou announced his bid for Taiwan’s presidency last month and intention to step down, questions have abounded over who else could lead the $41-billion empire that is the world’s biggest assembler of iPhones.</p><p>Now, the company’s de facto chief financial officer and one of Gou’s closest aides, Huang Chiu-lian, is widely anticipated to succeed him.  </p><p>Known as “Money Mama” (in Chinese), Huang is the aunt of Gou’s late wife.

She is not listed on the official roster of the company’s management team, but in a 2003 annual report (pdf in Chinese) she is listed as the director of more than 90 Foxconn subsidiaries.

It has to do in part with Foxconn’s complex organizational structure, said Chung Hsi-Mei, a professor at I-Shou University in Taiwan who studies corporate governance.

US and Iran </p><p>The United States says it has multiple images of Iranian commercial ships in the Persian Gulf that it believes are carrying missiles. An official told CNN that recent surveillance has shown some of the ships moving in and out of Iranian ports in the recent days. CNN hasn\'t reviewed the intelligence that led to this assessment. And the government hasn\'t provided any proof the ships are carrying hidden missiles or any other munitions. All this comes as the United States has moved bombers and a carrier strike group into the region. Fears of a potential military conflict between the countries have increased over the past couple of weeks. Officials in Washington are debating whether Iran is planning to attack US assets or whether it is acting defensively in an attempt to deter US action.</p><p>2. Taiwan</p><p>Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage today, becoming the first place in Asia to pass such legislation. Lawmakers took up the controversial issue after the island\'s Constitutional Court ruled that the existing law -- which said marriage was between a man and a woman -- was unconstitutional. The bill passed today goes into effect at the end of next week. Gay rights seems to have regressed in the rest of Asia. Homosexuality is legal in mainland China, but prejudices and discrimination persist under the Communist Party. And just last month, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the ruler of Brunei, said he\'d introduce death by stoning for those convicted of gay sex. (He later walked that back.) More than two dozen countries around the world allow same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center.</p><p>3. Pregnant woman killed</p><p>Police arrested and charged three people in a ghastly killing of a pregnant teen in Chicago. Marlen Ochoa-Lopez, 19, disappeared late last month after she went to receive an offer of free baby clothes from a woman she had communicated with online. Ochoa-Lopez\'s body was found Tuesday in a garbage can in the backyard of the woman who had offered the clothes. She had been strangled and her unborn baby forcibly removed from her womb, police said. The baby is in grave condition at a hospital. Two people, including the woman who police say lured the teen to the home, were charged with murder, while a third person was charged with concealment of a crime. Here are some safety tips to remember if you\'re meeting someone to buy or sell items in online transactions.</p><p>4. SAT tests</p><p>Students who come from tough backgrounds just might catch a break the next time they take the SAT. The College Board, the nonprofit group that runs the standardized test, said it will start assigning a score to students who take the SAT to reflect their social and economic backgrounds. The Environmental Context Dashboard would factor in things such as crime and poverty in a student\'s neighborhood to capture their \"resourcefulness to overcome challenges and achieve more with less.\" This dashboard score will not include a student\'s race. College admissions are under heightened scrutiny after indictments were handed down against wealthy and powerful parents who allegedly paid their kids\' ways into elite universities.</p><p>5. Canada and the Philippines</p><p>Canada and the Philippines are feeling some kind of way about each other right now. The two countries are having a diplomatic squabble -- over trash. And not just any old trash, mind you. They\'re fighting about 6-year-old trash. The tensions have gotten so bad that the Philippines has recalled its ambassador to Canada. This trash tiff started in 2013 when more than 100 containers of material from Canada arrived in the Port of Manila. It was supposed to be recyclable plastic; it turned out to be nonrecyclable plastic, household waste and diapers. Now Canada is accused of violating an international treaty governing the transport of hazardous waste.

Bipartisan consensus has swung hard against Beijing in recent years, with some opposition lawmakers in Washington even calling on Trump to take a harder approach. </p><p>\"There is a broad hawkishness on China that straddles left, right, and center,\" said Patrick Lozada, China director at the Washington-based strategic advisory firm Albright Stonebridge Group (ASG). \"The problem with this consensus is that in the absence of a credible counter-argument, the actual facts on the ground can sometimes be lost as people compete to see who can be more hawkish.\"</p><p>Trade war</p><p>When Trump introduced new tariffs on Chinese products last year, there were complaints from top Democrats -- that he didn\'t go far enough. </p><p>\"The United States must take strong, smart and strategic action against China\'s brazenly unfair trade policies,\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said at the time. \"Yet, today\'s announcement is merely a start, and the Trump Administration must do much more to fight for American workers and products.\" </p><p>Even today, as the expansion of those tariffs have started to bite both consumers and manufacturers at home, offering a tantalizing attack line for Democrats in 2020, criticisms from those in the party\'s leadership are of Trump\'s execution, not his target. </p><p>\"We should not be having a multifront war on tariffs,\" Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer said this week. \"I would focus everything on China.

When President Trump took office, they regarded him as a transactional businessman without taking serious his remarks about trade on the campaign trail and growing skepticism of China\'s role in the global economy at all levels.\"</p><p>Bipartisan China hawkishness isn\'t only hurting Beijing on trade either. </p><p>Human rights, often an overlooked topic in relations with Beijing, have come back to the fore, along with calls for punitive sanctions that would further weaken China\'s economy in the middle of a trade war. </p><p>This week, leading Hong Kong democrats were on Capitol Hill to testify before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), a bipartisan panel which issues an annual report on the state of human rights in China and has grown in influence under the Trump administration. </p><p>In his opening remarks, CECC chair James McGovern, a Democratic congressman, said he believed \"it is time for the United States to consider new and innovative policies to support the people of Hong Kong.\" </p><p>McGovern and others have suggested Washington review the US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, under which it treats the city as a separate customs territory to the rest of China, so long as Hong Kong remains \"sufficiently autonomous.\" Suspending Hong Kong\'s special status could devastate the city\'s economy and also hit Beijing hard, given its reliance on Hong Kong\'s financial sector. </p><p>CECC members, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio, have called for China to be sanctioned under the Magnitsky Acts for its oppression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands if not millions of mostly Muslim people have been detained in \"re-education camps.\" </p><p>The Magnitsky Acts, which impose visa sanctions and asset freezes on alleged human rights violators, were originally introduced to go after Russia and have since been expanded to target officials from Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.</p><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Rubio, have called for China to be added to the list. Doing so would strike a major blow against the finances and freedom to travel of top Chinese officials, but would also torpedo any hopes of improving relations with Beijing. </p><p>Dangers of further split </p><p>Despite widespread skepticism and hostility towards China in Washington today, better bilateral relations in the past paid off for both countries. China\'s economy exploded after it entered the WTO in 2000, and the US has long enjoyed the benefits of cheap Chinese manufacturing. </p><p>The chances of relations reaching a breaking point and turning into an open conflict are slight, but very real. US military leaders have expressed alarm over China\'s moves in the South China Sea and towards Taiwan, as Washington has ramped up its own military engagement in the region, something Beijing regards as a provocation. </p><p>Taiwan has bought weapons from the US and lobbied for even greater support from Washington. The island\'s de facto independence from China has always been guaranteed to some extent by a belief that the US may come to its aid in a military conflict with Beijing. </p><p>While relations are unlikely to sour to the point of actual conflict there is a risk of a new Cold War developing, with other nations forced to choose sides. </p><p>That could create a bloc allied against Washington, something that it has not faced since the height of the original Cold War. As commentator Henry Luce wrote in December, better relations between Washington and Beijing under Nixon helped exacerbate the Sino-Soviet split, one factor which resulted in the USSR\'s eventual collapse. </p><p>\"Mr Trump is triggering a \'reverse Nixon\',\" Luce wrote. \"Decades of convergence is going into reverse. It is happening at a speed that is taking even Americans by surprise.\" </p><p>That was five months ago, and things have only sped up since then. </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190514120353-trump-story-body.jpg','[\"177\", \"150\", \"132\"]',0,'特朗普的貿易戰表明中國在華盛頓失去了所有朋友',NULL,'本週，領導香港民主黨人在國會山前向國會 - 中國執行委員會（CECC）作證，這是一個兩黨小組，發表關於中國人權狀況的年度報告，並在特朗普政府的影響下發展壯大。','<p>香港（美國有線電視新聞網）與中國建立更好的關係曾經是華盛頓的兩黨關係問題。 </p><p>從1972年理查德尼克松歷史訪問北京開始，後來的政府 - 民主黨和共和黨 - 都致力於改善與北京的關係。 </p><p>民主黨人吉米卡特在台灣正式承認中華人民共和國，共和黨老布什在天安門大屠殺後的幾年裡與中國領導人保持對話，民主黨人比爾克林頓支持中國加入世界貿易組織（WTO）。 </p><p>在唐納德特朗普總統執政期間，這種穩定性和可靠性的感覺已經開始解開。本週，由於與北京的貿易戰惡化導致雙方經濟困難，他加大了對中國電信巨頭華為的打擊力度。 </p><p>但是，雖然有許多話題，特朗普是一個破壞者，與他的一些共和黨同事不一致，更不用說民主黨了，但事實並非如此。最近幾年，兩黨共識對北京採取了強硬立場，華盛頓的一些反對派立法者甚至呼籲特朗普採取更加強硬的態度。 </p><p>華盛頓戰略諮詢公司奧爾布賴特斯通布里奇集團（ASG）的中國區總監帕特里克羅扎達表示，“中國的左翼，右翼和中心都存在著強烈的強硬態度。” “這種共識的問題在於，如果沒有可靠的反駁論點，當人們競相看誰更加強硬時，實際的實際情況有時會丟失。” </p><p>貿易戰</p><p>當特朗普去年對中國產品徵收新的關稅時，有民主黨高層人士的投訴 - 他說得還不夠。 </p><p> “美國必須對中國肆無忌憚的不公平貿易政策採取強有力的，明智的戰略行動，”國會女議員南希佩洛西當時表示。 “然而，今天的公告只是一個開始，特朗普政府必須做更多的事情來為美國工人和產品而戰。” </p><p>即便在今天，由於這些關稅的擴大已經開始在國內蠶食消費者和製造商，在2020年為民主黨人提供了誘人的攻擊線，黨內領導人的批評是特朗普的執行，而不是他的目標。 </p><p> “我們不應該對關稅進行多邊戰爭，”民主黨參議員查克舒默本週表示。 “我會把一切都集中在中國。讓歐洲人，加拿大人和墨西哥人站在我們一邊，專注於中國。因為他們是最大的危險。” </p><p>在特朗普的過道方面，共和黨人希望對中國採取更加強硬的立場，甚至在許多人試圖阻止他擴大對歐洲盟國的關稅時，對他的交易提出批評的聲音已被超越。 </p><p>參議員約翰巴拉索週三對美國有線電視新聞網說：“總統對中國的立場是正確的。” “如果不是因為總統所做的事情，他們就不會進行談判......總統有他自己的時間表。我支持他正在做的事情。” </p><p>廣闊的前線</p><p> “我很難想到美國外交政策中的另一個共識，就像美國對中國的共識一樣迅速，”紐約智庫外交關係委員會主席理查德哈斯表示， 2月份說。 </p><p> “人們對中國的貿易行為和技術盜竊感到厭倦。但這也反映了中國內部的情況......維吾爾人的待遇，總統取消（任期）限制。這也是因為南海等戰略問題以及中國在那裡所做的事情。“ </p><p> ASG分析師羅扎達表示，“北京未能抓住美國政治變化的本質以及對中國改革步伐緩慢的擔憂。當特朗普總統就職時，他們認為他是一個交易商人而沒有認真對待他。關於競選活動中貿易的評論以及對中國在各級全球經濟中的作用越來越懷疑。“ </p><p>兩黨中國的強硬態度不僅傷害了北京的貿易。 </p><p>人權問題，往往是與北京關係中被忽視的話題，已經重新出現，同時呼籲採取懲罰性制裁措施，這將進一步削弱中國在貿易戰中的經濟。 </p><p>本週，領導香港民主黨人在國會山前向國會 - 中國執行委員會（CECC）作證，這是一個兩黨小組，發表關於中國人權狀況的年度報告，並在特朗普政府的影響下發展壯大。 </p><p>民主黨國會議員，CECC主席詹姆斯麥戈文在致開幕辭時說，他認為“現在是時候讓美國考慮採取新的創新政策來支持香港人”。 </p><p>麥戈文和其他人建議華盛頓審查1992年的美國 - 香港政策法案，根據該法案，只要香港保持“足夠自治”，它就將該城市視為中國其他地區的獨立關稅區。由於依賴香港的金融業，暫停香港的特殊地位可能會破壞該市的經濟，並對北京造成嚴重打擊。 </p><p>包括共和黨參議員馬克盧比奧在內的中國國家經濟委員會成員呼籲中國根據馬格尼茨基法案對新疆維吾爾族少數民族的壓迫進行製裁，新疆數十萬甚至數百萬穆斯林人口被拘留在“再教育營地” “。 </p><p>馬格尼茨基法案對被指控的侵犯人權者實行簽證制裁和資產凍結，最初被引入俄羅斯，後來擴大到針對緬甸，沙特阿拉伯和其他國家的官員。 </p><p>由盧比奧領導的兩黨立法者組織呼籲將中國列入名單。這樣做會對中國高級官員的財務和旅行自由造成重大打擊，但也會破壞改善與北京關係的希望。 </p><p>進一步分裂的危險</p><p>儘管今天華盛頓對中國普遍存在懷疑和敵視，但過去兩國關係的改善為兩國帶來了回報。 2000年加入WTO後，中國經濟出現爆發，美國長期享受廉價中國製造業帶來的好處。 </p><p>關係達到突破點並變成公開衝突的可能性很小，但非常真實。美國軍方領導人對中國在南中國海和台灣的行動表示震驚，因為華盛頓加強了自己在該地區的軍事行動，北京認為這是一種挑釁。 </p><p>台灣已從美國購買武器，並遊說華盛頓提供更多支持。島上事實上獨立於中國在某種程度上一直得到保證，美國可能會在與北京的軍事衝突中援助它。 </p><p>雖然關係不太可能惡化到實際衝突的程度，但新冷戰可能會發展，而其他國家則被迫選擇雙方。 </p><p>這可能會形成一個與華盛頓結盟的集團，這是自從最初的冷戰高峰以來它沒有面對的事情。正如評論員亨利·盧斯（Henry Luce）12月所寫的那樣，尼克鬆在華盛頓和北京之間建立更好的關係，加劇了中蘇分裂，這是導致蘇聯最終崩潰的一個因素。 </p><p> “特朗普先生正在觸發&#39;反向尼克松&#39;，”盧斯寫道。 “幾十年的趨同正在逆轉。它的發生速度甚至讓美國人感到意外。” </p><p>那是五個月前，事情從那時起才加速。 </p><p></p>'),(366,3,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/asia/taiwan-same-sex-marriage-intl/index.html','Taiwan legalizes same-sex marriage in historic first for Asia',NULL,'(CNN)Lawmakers in Taiwan have approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, a landmark decision that makes the self-ruled island the first place in Asia to pass gay marriage legislation.','By Julia Hollingsworth, CNN','2019-05-17T20:07:53Z',1558123673000,'<p> (CNN)Lawmakers in Taiwan have approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, a landmark decision that makes the self-ruled island the first place in Asia to pass gay marriage legislation. </p><p>The vote came almost two years after the island\'s Constitutional Court ruled that the existing law -- which said marriage was between a man and a woman -- was unconstitutional.

La Monica, CNN Business','2019-05-17T20:20:03Z',1558124403000,'<p>New York (CNN Business)China\'s Starbucks has arrived on Wall Street. Luckin Coffee begin trading on Friday and provided an immediate caffeine jolt to the market. The stock surged nearly 50% to $25 a share before pulling back. Shares closed up about 20%.</p><p>Luckin Coffee, which is growing rapidly thanks to a focus on cheaper drinks, priced its initial public offering on the Nasdaq at $17 a share. That was at the high end of its range and it values Luckin Coffee (LK) at more than $4 billion. Luckin raised more than $570 million from the stock sale.</p><p>Luckin Coffee has quickly taken China by storm. The company, which was founded in October 2017, already has nearly 2,400 stores in 28 cities. That makes it second only to Starbucks (SBUX) in China.</p><p>But Luckin Coffee is likely to soon pass its larger rival. Luckin Coffee has plans to open 2,000 additional stores in the country by the end of the year, bringing its total to about 4,500 locations.</p><p>It\'s an ambitious goal, especially since Chinese consumers aren\'t addicted to coffee as much as drinkers in the United States and other nations are. Tea is the beverage of choice.</p><p>Taking China by storm with cheaper coffee</p><p>Luckin Coffee cited data from consumer research firm Frost & Sullivan in its IPO filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that showed Chinese consumers drank only six cups of coffee a year in 2018, compared to 279 for Japan, 388 in the US and a whopping 867 in Germany.</p><p>But Luckin Coffee is hoping that the popularity of Starbucks in China, coupled with Luckin Coffee\'s plans to offer less expensive brews, will quickly create more coffee drinkers in mainland China. </p><p>After all, Frost & Sullivan said that consumers in nearby Taiwan and Hong Kong each drink more than 200 cups of coffee a year.</p><p>Still, Luckin Coffee is tiny compared to Starbucks, which plans to expand even further in China as the US market matures. And like many other startup firms that have recently gone public — including Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER), Pinterest (PINS) and Beyond Meat (BYND) — Luckin Coffee is bleeding red ink.</p><p>The company reported a net loss of $241.3 million last year on sales of just $125.3 million. Luckin Coffee lost another $82.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 on revenue of only $71.3 million.</p><p>Luckin will lose money to gain market share</p><p>Luckin Coffee says this trend will continue, as it plans more store openings and increased marketing while also keeping its coffee prices more affordable in order to steal customers from Starbucks.</p><p>\"We intend to further increase our brand awareness, expand our customer base and store network, and expect to continue to invest heavily in offering discounts and deals,\" the company said in its SEC filing.</p><p>Luckin Coffee chief financial officer Reinout Schakel reiterated this in an interview with CNN\'s Julia Chatterley on Friday. He said the company wants to \"help people save money.\"</p><p>Schakel added that the company is investing a lot on technology and is confident that these investments will help keep costs down for the long-term. </p><p>He said the goal is to offer \"high quality coffee for a much more affordable price and still become profitable.\"  </p><p>\"The market is in its infancy. I think there\'s a huge opportunity\" Schakel said, adding that coffee in China is now viewed as more of a luxury product and that Luckin Coffee wants to make it \"a part of everyday life.\"</p><p>Chinese consumers love the coupons</p><p>He also brushed off concerns about the trade war with the United States, saying that because the company already does a good job of keeping costs low and is selling its coffee at a discount to Starbucks, there should be little impact on its sales and customer base.</p><p>To that end, Chinese consumers in Beijing told CNN that price is one of Luckin Coffee\'s biggest selling points.</p><p>\"It has great value. A Starbucks coffee usually costs around 40 yuan (nearly $6 USD). Here we use coupons a lot. It\'s usually around 20 with discounts. So value is the first consideration,\" said Terasa Wang, a sales manager. </p><p>Shilu Wang, a director and producer, added that she was first attracted to Luckin Coffee \"because it gave me lots of coupons, like the first free orders. No other coffee brand does that.\" She added that \"the taste is good for the price\" and that delivery was fast.</p><p>So it looks like Starbucks is going to have a tough battle with Luckin Coffee for the foreseeable future.</p><p>-- CNN\'s Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.</p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190506133359-luckin-coffee-story-body.jpg','[\"223\", \"170\", \"319\"]',61,'Luckin Coffee在華爾街首次亮相',NULL,'“中國消費者喜歡這些優惠券他也對美國與貿易戰的擔憂表示不滿，稱由於該公司已經做好了保持低成本並且以低於星巴克的價格出售咖啡的方式，因此應該對其銷售和客戶群。','<p>紐約（CNN Business）中國的星巴克已抵達華爾街。 Luckin Coffee週五開始交易，並立即向市場提供咖啡因衝擊。在撤回之前，該股飆升近50％至每股25美元。股價收漲約20％。 </p><p> Luckin Coffee由於專注於更便宜的飲料而迅速增長，其在納斯達克的首次公開募股定價為每股17美元。那是在其範圍的高端，它使Luckin Coffee（LK）價值超過40億美元。 Luckin從股票銷售中籌集了超過5.7億美元。 </p><p> Luckin Coffee很快就把風暴帶到了中國。該公司成立於2017年10月，已在28個城市擁有近2,400家門店。這使其僅次於中國的星巴克（SBUX）。 </p><p>但Luckin Coffee可能很快就會通過其較大的競爭對手。 Luckin Coffee計劃在今年年底前在該國開設2,000家店鋪，使其總數達到約4,500個。 </p><p>這是一個雄心勃勃的目標，特別是因為中國消費者並不像美國和其他國家的飲酒者那樣沉迷於咖啡。茶是首選的飲料。 </p><p>用更便宜的咖啡帶走中國</p><p> Luckin Coffee引用消費者研究公司Frost＆Sullivan在向美國證券交易委員會提交的IPO文件中的數據顯示，中國消費者在2018年每年只喝六杯咖啡，而日本為279杯，美國為388杯，高達867元。在德國。 </p><p>但Luckin Coffee希望星巴克在中國的受歡迎程度，再加上Luckin Coffee計劃提供更便宜的啤酒，將很快在中國大陸創造更多的咖啡飲用者。 </p><p>畢竟，Frost＆Sullivan說，台灣和香港附近的消費者每人每年喝200多杯咖啡。 </p><p>儘管如此，與星巴克相比，Luckin Coffee仍然很小，隨著美國市場的成熟，星巴克計劃在中國進一步擴張。和最近上市的許多其他創業公司一樣 - 包括Lyft（LYFT），Uber（UBER），Pinterest（PINS）和Beyond Meat（BYND） -  Luckin Coffee正在流血紅色。 </p><p>該公司去年的淨虧損為2.413億美元，銷售額僅為1.253億美元。 Luckin Coffee在2019年第一季度又損失了8220萬美元，收入僅為7130萬美元。 </p><p> Luckin將虧損以獲得市場份額</p><p> Luckin Coffee表示，這一趨勢將持續下去，因為它計劃增加店面開張和增加營銷，同時保持咖啡價格更便宜，以便從星巴克竊取顧客。 </p><p> “我們打算進一步提高我們的品牌知名度，擴大我們的客戶群和商店網絡，並期望繼續大力投資提供折扣和交易，”該公司在其SEC文件中表示。 </p><p> Luckin Coffee首席財務官Reinout Schakel週五在接受CNN的Julia Chatterley採訪時重申了這一點。他說該公司希望“幫助人們省錢”。 </p><p> Schakel補充說，該公司正在大力投資技術，並相信這些投資將有助於長期降低成本。 </p><p>他說，我們的目標是以更實惠的價格提供“優質咖啡，並且仍能盈利。” </p><p> “市場處於起步階段。我認為這是一個巨大的機會”Schakel說，並補充說，中國的咖啡現在被視為更多的奢侈品，而Luckin Coffee希望將其作為“日常生活的一部分”。 </p><p>中國消費者喜歡優惠券</p><p>他還對美國與貿易戰的擔憂表示不滿，稱由於該公司已經做好了保持低成本並且以低於星巴克的價格出售咖啡，因此對其銷售和客戶群的影響不大。 。 </p><p>為此，北京的中國消費者告訴CNN，價格是Luckin Coffee最大的賣點之一。 </p><p> “它具有很大的價值。星巴克的咖啡通常價格約為40元人民幣（近6美元）。這裡我們經常使用優惠券。折扣通常在20左右。所以價值是首要考慮因素，”銷售經理Terasa Wang說。 </p><p>導演兼製片人Shilu Wang補充說，她第一次被Luckin Coffee吸引，“因為它給了我很多優惠券，就像第一批免費訂單一樣。沒有其他咖啡品牌能做到這一點。”她補充說，“味道對價格有利”，交貨速度很快。 </p><p>因此，在可預見的未來，星巴克似乎將與Luckin Coffee展開激烈的競爭。 </p><p> -  CNN的Serenitie Wang為本報告做出了貢獻。 </p><p></p>'),(374,2,'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-48254477','',NULL,'com/nzmxeTmgOYEnd of Twitter post  by @TaiwanNews886Students at New Taipei Municipal Banqiao Senior High School posted their support on Facebook, including the head teacher, Lai Chunjin, who said: \"We want to break gender stereotypes and respect differences in temperament.','By Sherie Ryder and Kerry Allen',NULL,1557759442000,'<p>Men of all ages have been gathering on the streets of Taiwan wearing skirts, as part of events organised to challenge gender stereotypes and raise awareness of Taiwan\'s long-awaited marriage bill.</p><p>Discussions will take place in parliament on Friday, and legislation for same-sex marriage will be either passed or rejected on 24 May.

That predictive growth is very attractive to Amazon\".</p><p>Amazon had previously been reported to have made approaches to buy Deliveroo outright. Uber also reportedly had talks with Deliveroo over buying it.</p><p>It was already a fierce contest - now the battle to dominate the food delivery business in the UK just  moved to a whole new level. </p><p>In a rare failure Amazon decided last year to pull its Restaurants food service out of a UK market where Deliveroo, Just Eat and  Uber Eats were scrapping to be top dog. Now it\'s put its firepower behind Deliveroo, which was already confident that its technology platform gave it the edge. </p><p>The company will now use some of its extra cash to build more of its \"super kitchens\" expanding its offering beyond traditional restaurants and invest more in machine learning to speed up delivery times.</p><p>Whether the market for food deliveries is quite as big as all the firms believe - and whether it stretches far beyond London twenty-somethings - remains to be seen but they all seem prepared to spend big money to win the lion\'s share.  </p><p>The question is why did Amazon not just buy the whole business? Perhaps the ecommerce giant wanted to sample a starter before swallowing the whole three course meal.</p><p>Deliveroo now operates in more than 100 towns and cities across the UK, but has a much smaller share of the market than rival Just Eat which dominates the food delivery sector.</p><p>Just Eat\'s shares fell 8% in early trading, but analysts at Liberum said that despite the extra funding, Deliveroo was unlikely to become a serious competitor.</p><p>\"Just Eat\'s market leading position will be incredibly difficult to overcome, especially given its strength in smaller towns. </p><p>\"In the UK, it has an estimated 3-4 times greater share than Uber Eats and Deliveroo combined and, crucially, 60%+ of its customers are in small towns where it is effectively the only option for restaurants and where the Uber Eats/Deliveroo model just doesn\'t work because of the economics,\" Liberum said. </p><p>Mr Shu came up with the idea for the firm after he moved from New York to London as a banking analyst.

mostly using bikes or moped - to deliver food from restaurants to customers.</p><p>Deliveroo does not employ its riders directly, but pays them per delivery.</p><p>Last year, a group of 50 UK Deliveroo couriers won a six-figure payout after claiming they had been unlawfully denied holiday and minimum wages.</p>',NULL,'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/168DB/production/_106997329_deliveroo_getty.jpg','[\"402\", \"3\", \"4\"]',0,'亞馬遜投資Deliveroo食品快遞',NULL,'在一次罕見的失敗中，亞馬遜去年決定將其餐廳食品服務從英國市場撤出，其中Deliveroo，Just Eat和Uber Eats正在努力成為頂級狗。','<p>在線巨頭亞馬遜宣布對食品快遞Deliveroo進行大筆投資。 </p><p>確切的數字沒有給出，但亞馬遜是Deliveroo最新一輪融資的最大投資者，總計籌資5.75億美元（4.5億英鎊）。 </p><p> Deliveroo表示將利用這筆資金進行國際擴張，改善服務並發展其僅供交付的廚房業務。 </p><p>一些現有的美國投資者也為籌集資金做出了貢獻。 </p><p>自2013年成立以來，Deliveroo投資的資金總額已超過15億美元，該公司是歐洲發展最快的科技公司之一。 </p><p> Deliveroo創始人兼首席執行官Will Shu表示，他期待與像亞馬遜這樣的“像客戶一樣迷戀”的組織合作。 </p><p>亞馬遜表示，Deliveroo的“創新技術服務”吸引了它。 </p><p>來自亞馬遜的支持讓Deliveroo對JustEat和Uber Eats等競爭對手有所提升。 </p><p>這家在線零售商短暫擁有自己的英國食品交付企業亞馬遜餐廳英國，它於2016年開業，但僅在兩年後關閉。 </p><p>投資公司Hermes的基金經理路易斯·達德利告訴記者，“他們（亞馬遜）無法在市場中競爭，因此他們選擇購買期權。他們有錢支持他們做這件事。” BBC的今日節目。 </p><p> “它[Deliveroo]不僅僅是一家食品配送公司，它還是一家科技公司。他們擁有這個非常有吸引力的技術平台。他們能夠擴展到新的領域並思考人們的品味如何發展和能夠預測哪些商店會成功。預測增長對亞馬遜非常有吸引力“。 </p><p>據報導亞馬遜曾經採取過直接購買Deliveroo的方法。據報導，優步還與Deliveroo就購買它進行了談判。 </p><p>這已經是一場激烈的競爭 -

Mr Li is a student of pharmacy from the eastern Chinese province of Shandong. In March he released a startling self-recorded video in which he denounced China’s decision, unveiled about a year ago, to scrap the ten-year term limit for the presidency. He compared China’s current leader, Xi Jinping, to an “emperor”. Most Chinese students in Taiwan keep quiet about politics at home. But Mr Li says living in Taiwan’s “model democracy” inspired him to speak out. Last month he applied for political asylum there.</p><p>Liberal thinkers in China have long been fascinated by Taiwan’s politics because of the island’s close cultural and historical links with the mainland. At the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, the defeated Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist Party, took refuge on the island and ruled it with the same contempt for democracy that the victorious Communist Party displayed in China. But Taiwan succeeded economically, producing a middle class that began pushing for reform. Eventually, in 1996, Taiwan held its first democratic presidential election. The KMT won but the next time, four years later, it was defeated.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Despite the Communists’ efforts to portray Taiwanese democracy as a raucous farce, the island’s orderly political evolution has inspired some people in China. Even so, in recent years, as cross-strait economic links have boomed, China has allowed many thousands of students to experience the island’s freedoms for themselves, just as it had permitted students to head to universities in the West. In 2018 nearly 30,000 Chinese students were enrolled at Taiwanese universities, more than ten times as many as a decade earlier.</p><p>The students’ presence is a sign that both sides have become less worried about exposing future members of their elites to the ideologies of their foes (technically, China and Taiwan are still at war). In China’s case it reflects confidence that its youth are unlikely to be won over by Taiwan’s view of itself as a sovereign country with every right to resist China’s claim to it. Recently China has reduced the flow. But the main purpose has been to show displeasure with Taiwan rather than limit exposure to its democracy.</p><p>The Communist Party does remain determined to protect its population from heretical thinking. Less than three hours after Mr Li circulated his video on Twitter, censors in China responded by shutting down his accounts on Chinese social media, apparently fearing that he might use them to post similar material. Mr Li says his parents in Shandong were briefly detained by police. He believes a “terrible fate” awaits him should he return.</p><p>But in its approach to student exchanges with Taiwan, other considerations have trumped China’s ideological reservations: a desire to satisfy burgeoning demand at home for education abroad, as well as to boost support for China on the island itself. China’s relations with Taiwan entered a deep freeze after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took over in 2000—the Communists despise the party because of its rejection of reunification. But after the KMT returned to power in 2008 China began working hard to foster business, tourism and academic links. That was a boon for Taiwanese universities which were worrying about falling enrolment. In 2010 Taiwan changed its law to admit Chinese students not only for brief exchange programmes but also for degree courses. The following year the total number of Chinese students in Taiwan more than doubled, to nearly 12,200.</p><p>Since the DPP’s return to power in 2016 China has cut the number of students it allows to study for undergraduate degrees on the island, from about 2,100 who began such courses that year to 800 in 2018. The number of exchange students has also fallen, from 33,000 in 2016 to 21,000. But the number of Chinese students in Taiwan remains far higher than it was during the DPP’s first period in power between 2000 and 2008. When the party was ousted, there were just 1,300 of them.</p><p>China still has anxieties. Its Taiwan Affairs Office arranges pre-departure “coaching sessions” for Taiwan-bound students, involving lectures on Communist Party policy towards the island and instructions to stick to it. China tries to deter its students from registering at universities in Taiwan where student unions have a reputation for organising pro-independence activities. One such institution is National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Tainan. In 2017 newly admitted Chinese students to NCKU reportedly received calls from Chinese officials warning them not to attend.</p><p>Around two years ago, Taiwan’s education ministry discovered that some Taiwanese universities had signed agreements, requested by their Chinese counterparts, promising that Chinese exchange students would not be exposed in class to “politically sensitive” ideas such as Taiwanese independence. An official at a private university in Taiwan reckons as many as half of the island’s universities did so, including his own. The education ministry’s official responsible for cross-strait education, Andy Bi, says his department reminded these universities of the importance of academic freedom. The deals have since been scrapped, he says. But China had made its point clear.</p><p>For all China’s precautions, some Chinese students do come round to Taiwan’s political way of thinking. In 2010-11 Wang Chia-chou of I-Shou University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second city, surveyed some 200 Chinese students in Taiwan, both when they arrived and again four months later. He found that the students’ average “regime identification” with Taiwan shifted considerably over this short period. At the time of arrival it was -0.72 compared with -0.04 four months later, where preference for China’s politics is given a value of -1 and for Taiwan’s a value of 1. In other words, the students on average moved from strong preference for China’s system to near neutrality.</p><p>Mr Wang, who teaches politics, recalls one Chinese student insisting in class that “communism will prevail in Taiwan”. The student, however, later asked him in private how he could stay on the island (not, apparently, to await communism’s victory there). But many Chinese students claim to be unimpressed. To many of them Taiwan’s cities seem fusty in comparison with China’s boomtowns. “Just as I can learn from Taiwan, so too can my Taiwanese classmates learn from China,” says a Chinese student of public policy in Taipei. That kind of view gives China solace.</p>',NULL,'https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/articles/main/20190511_CND001.jpg','[\"175\", \"205\", \"167\"]',0,'中國擔心台灣的學習如何影響學生','但它仍然允許大量人數去那裡的大學','大約兩年前，台灣教育部發現一些台灣大學簽署了中國同行要求的協議，承諾中國的交換生不會在課堂上暴露出台灣獨立等“政治敏感”的觀點。','<p> SIPPING在台灣南部一個城市的一家時尚餐廳吃咖啡，李家寶看起來很平靜，儘管20歲的學生最近直言不諱地關注島上的校園。李先生是中國東部山東省藥學院的學生。 3月份，他發布了一段令人吃驚的自錄視頻，譴責中國大約一年前公佈的決定，取消了總統任期的十年任期限制。他將中國現任領導人習近平與“皇帝”進行了比較。台灣的大多數中國學生對國內政治保持沉默。但李先生說，生活在台灣的“模範民主”激勵他說出來。上個月他在那裡申請政治庇護。 </p><p>由於台灣與大陸的文化和歷史聯繫密切，中國的自由思想家長期以來一直對台灣的政治著迷。在1949年中國內戰結束時，被擊敗的國民黨（國民黨）在島上避難，並以同樣的蔑視民主的方式對其進行統治，而勝利的共產黨在中國也是如此。但台灣在經濟上取得了成功，產生了一個開始推動改革的中產階級。最終，在1996年，台灣舉行了第一次民主總統選舉。國民黨贏了但是下一次，四年後，它被擊敗了。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>儘管共產黨人把台灣民主描繪成一場喧鬧的鬧劇，但島上有條不紊的政治演變激發了中國的一些人。即便如此，近年來，隨著兩岸經濟聯繫的蓬勃發展，中國已經允許成千上萬的學生親身體驗島上的自由，就像它允許學生前往西方的大學一樣。 2018年，近30,000名中國學生在台灣大學就讀，是十年前的十倍多。 </p><p>學生們的存在表明雙方都不再擔心將未來的精英成員暴露給敵人的意識形態（從技術上講，中國和台灣仍處於戰爭狀態）。在中國的情況下，它反映了一種信心，即台灣認為自己是一個擁有抵抗中國主張權利的主權國家的年輕人不太可能贏得青年。最近中國減少了流量。但主要目的是表達對台灣的不滿，而不是限制其民主。 </p><p>共產黨確實仍然決心保護其人民不受異端思想的影響。在李先生在Twitter上發布視頻後不到三個小時，中國的審查機構就回應關閉了他在中國社交媒體上的賬戶，顯然擔心他可能會用他們發布類似的材料。李先生說他在山東的父母被警方短暫拘留。如果他回來，他相信“可怕的命運”等待著他。 </p><p>但在與台灣學生交流的方式上，其他考慮因素超越了中國的意識形態保留：希望滿足國內對海外教育的迅速增長需求，以及加強對中國在島上的支持。民進黨於2000年接任後，中國與台灣的關係陷入了嚴重凍結 - 共產黨人因拒絕統一而鄙視黨。但在2008年國民黨重新執政後，中國開始努力促進商業，旅遊和學術聯繫。對於擔心入學率下降的台灣大學來說，這是一個福音。 2010年，台灣改變了法律，不僅允許中國學生參加簡短的交流項目，還接受學位課程。次年，台灣的中國學生總數增加了一倍多，達到近12,200人。 </p><p>自2016年中國民主黨恢復執政以來，中國已經減少了允許在島上攻讀本科學位的學生人數，從當年開設此類課程的約2,100人到2018年的800人。交換生的數量也從2016年為33,000至21,000。但台灣的中國留學生人數遠遠高於民進黨2000年至2008年的第一個執政期間。當黨被驅逐時，他們只有1300人。 </p><p>中國仍然有焦慮。台灣事務辦公室為台灣學生安排出發前的“輔導課程”，包括關於共產黨對島嶼政策的講座以及堅持下台的指示。中國試圖阻止學生在台灣的大學註冊，在那裡學生會以組織支持獨立的活動而聞名。其中一個機構是台南國立成功大學（NCKU）。據報導，2017年新入學的中國學生到NCKU接到中國官員的電話，警告他們不要參加。 </p><p>大約兩年前，台灣教育部發現一些台灣大學簽署了中國同行要求的協議，承諾中國的交換生不會在課堂上暴露出台灣獨立等“政治敏感”的觀點。台灣一所私立大學的一名官員估計，該島上多達一半的大學都這樣做，包括他自己的大學。教育部負責兩岸教育的官員Andy Bi表示，他的部門提醒這些大學學術自由的重要性。他說，這些交易已被取消。但中國明確指出了這一點。 </p><p>對於所有中國的預防措施，一些中國學生確實接受了台灣的政治思維方式。 2010年至11月，台灣第二大城市高雄I-Shou大學的王家洲調查了大約200名台灣留學生，他們四個月後來到這裡。他發現學生對台灣的平均“政權認同”在這短短的時間內發生了相當大的變化。到達時為-0.72，四個月後為-0.04，中國政治的偏好值為-1，台灣的偏好值為1.換句話說，學生平均偏離強烈偏好中國的體制接近中立。 </p><p>教授政治的王先生回憶起一位中國學生堅持在課堂上堅持“共產主義將在台灣佔上風”。然而，這名學生後來私下問他如何留在島上（顯然不是為了等待共產主義在那裡的勝利）。但許多中國學生聲稱自己並不為所動。對於他們中的許多人而言，與中國的新興城市相比，台灣的城市似乎更加強大。 “就像我可以向台灣學習一樣，我的台灣同學也可以向中國學習，”台北一位中國公共政策學生說。這種觀點讓中國感到安慰。 </p>');

Marcus','null',1554213993000,'<p>中國和台灣之間的新危機迫在眉睫嗎？ </p><p>這些日益緊張的局勢如何與華盛頓與北京之間日益加深的分歧有關？ </p><p>特朗普總統是否破壞了他的前任所追求的長期“一個中國”的政策，這是20世紀70年代末中美之間和解的基礎？ </p><p>週日，中國戰機的入侵，穿越分隔中國和台灣海域的海上線路，是多年來最嚴重的此類事件。入侵的持續時間 - 大約十分鐘 - 表明這不僅僅是導航錯誤。 </p><p>台灣亂飛機攔截入侵者。台灣總統蔡英文呼籲跨越海上線的中國戰機被“強行驅逐”。 </p><p>台灣 - 當然 - 被北京視為中國不可分割的一部分;它與祖國的分離只是一種暫時的現象。 </p><p>中國國家主席習近平在今年年初警告稱，無論兩個政治體制的差異如何，統一仍然是中國的最終目標。他明確表示，中國不會“放棄使用武力”，並保留“採取一切必要措施”的選擇。 </p><p>中國仍然專注於台灣。事實上，許多美國戰略分析家認為重新建立北京對台灣的控制權是推動其軍事現代化計劃的首要目標。 </p><p>這裡的一個重要方面是西方解釋為北京的反接入和區域拒絕策略。簡單來說，這是開發更遠程和更準確的武器系統，以推動美國軍隊（可能來台灣的援助）進一步進入太平洋。 </p><p>上個月 - 為了表明它將繼續主張其自由通行權 - 美國派遣了一艘驅逐艦和一名海岸警衛隊通過中國台灣台灣海峽。這不可避免地讓北京感到不安，並被台灣人視為一種支持。 </p><p>鑑於華盛頓對該地區水域的廣泛要求，華盛頓努力證明其“航行自由”的含義在北京備受爭議。 </p><p>這是在中美緊張局勢升級的時候出現的，因為貿易，技術和中國日益增強的軍事自信心存在分歧。北京對經濟放緩感到不安，許多中國觀察家擔心這可能導致習主席採取更加民族主義的立場，很容易看出為什麼美中關係走向恐懼。 </p><p>本週末中國戰機的入侵也提醒了台灣的危險。 </p><p>並非總是如此。早在20世紀70年代末和80年代初，美國就建立了所謂的“一個中國”政策。 </p><p>它承認北京的共產黨政府是該國唯一的合法政府。它承認中國的立場，即只有一個中國。因此，台灣是中國的一部分。它降低了與台灣的聯繫。 </p><p>但同樣，它向北京明確表示，美國將“考慮通過非和平手段來決定台灣未來的任何努力”，因為它“令美國嚴重關切”。美國支持台灣的自衛，如果遭到襲擊，就有可能獲得台灣的援助。 </p><p>但面對中國日益增長的軍事能力，這項政策真的可信嗎？台灣是否會繼續對純粹的獨立而不是真實的東西感到滿意？特朗普政府是否向台灣發出錯誤信號？ </p><p>例如，特朗普先生成為自1979年以來第一位直接與台灣總統直接對話的當選總統。他的政府中的一些人希望重新審視整個“一個中國”的政策。 </p><p>北京看到這位美國總統放棄了軍控協議，改變了中東對耶路撒冷和戈蘭高地的外交現狀。他們可能會擔心美國對台政策的類似轉變。

</p><p>在玩家發現所謂的“復活節彩蛋”並宣傳它們之後，遊戲迅速傳播開來。但是，在線討論後來一直受到審查。 </p><p> “復活節彩蛋”是計算機遊戲中隱藏的消息或笑話，通常只有一些玩家密切關注。 </p><p>紅蠟燭遊戲已經道歉，稱它將退還被冒犯的用戶。 </p><p>台灣是一個獨立的實用目的島嶼，但中國將其視為反叛地區，並堅持其他國家不應與之建立外交關係。

</p><p>但是周一，搜索#Devotion標籤只顯示了四個帖子，其中沒有一個是遊戲。 </p><p>提到英國遊戲標題的帖子，審查人員在審查中往往不嚴格，這表明中國用戶正在Steam上接收消息，說該遊戲“不再可用”在他們的國家玩。 </p><p>與此同時，Red Candle在中國Twitter上的新浪微博服務賬號已被暫停，阻止該公司在大陸宣傳其遊戲。

</p><p>從技術上講，Steam尚未獲得在該國運營的正式批准，但仍然可以訪問。估計約有3000萬人在中國使用它。 </p><p>該平台允許中國用戶下載和玩未經官方授權的遊戲。 </p><p>在過去十年中，如果政府認為其內容被認為是暴力或反北京，政府已經禁止遊戲。然而，由於監管機構尚未審查長達數年的積壓遊戲，許多最近發布的版本從未進入過中國。

</p><p>中國不允許各國與台灣和台灣建立官方關係，因為它認為該島是一個脫離的省份，它發誓要在必要時通過武力重新奪回。 </p><p>但eSwatini政府表示將繼續堅守台灣。 </p><p>去年6月簽署的一項新的經濟協議剛剛生效，並將看到南部非洲國家向台灣免稅出口某些商品 - 包括蜂蜜和鱷梨。 </p><p> “這是國家利益最重要的事情，”長期服務的eSwatini政府發言人Percy

</p><p>由於諸如對二戰後和冷戰後國際條約和和解的不同解釋等因素，爭議更加複雜。 </p><p> 1945年，日本將對被佔領的台灣及周邊島嶼的控制權移交給中華民國（ROC）。 </p><p>四年後，中華民國政府在內戰中失去了中國大陸並逃往台灣。 </p><p>共產黨人很快成立了一個競爭政府 - 中華人民共和國（中華人民共和國） - 或者我們今天所知的中國。 </p><p>如今，中華人民共和國堅持認為，大陸和台灣都屬於“一個中國”，保留了重新統一國家的權利。 </p><p>台灣仍然正式稱為中華民國，它認為作為一個民主社會，最終的選擇在於台灣人民。 </p><p>在中國和台灣之間長達數十年的爭端中，ESwatini可能會堅持自己的立場，但不是每個人都參與其中。 </p><p>拒絕接受該國新名稱的斯威士蘭共產黨表示，雙方都是非法的，只是在國際舞台上相互支持。 </p><p>該黨的國際秘書Njabulo Dlamini說：“斯威士蘭人民處於貧困狀態[因為政府]正在使用直接來自台灣的捐款。” </p><p>這位直言不諱的老師，古巴社會的崇拜者和自稱為革命的革命者，是仍然生活在eSwatini的少數共產黨官員之一。 </p><p> “斯威士蘭不會受益[但]君主制和君主制的朋友直接受益於這種非法和非法的關係，”他補充說。 </p><p>根據世界銀行的數據，貧困是eSwatini面臨的主要挑戰，38％的人口生活在赤貧之中。 </p><p>這個僅有130萬人口的內陸小國依賴於鄰國南非約85％的進口產品，其出口約佔其出口的60％。 </p><p>台灣領導人質疑中國堅持認為它是一個省，反而認為它是一個主權國家。 </p><p>它有自己的憲法，民主選舉產生的領導人，以及在其武裝部隊中約有30萬名現役部隊。它還與約20個國家建立了外交關係。 </p><p>然而，聯合國自1971年以來一直沒有承認台灣政府，當時它改變了對中國的外交承認。 </p><p> ESwatini的國王姆斯瓦蒂三世是非洲最後一位絕對的君主，並且已經17次訪問台灣，包括2018年6月，當時他接受了他兒子畢業的同一所大學的管理榮譽學位。 </p><p>去年9月，當非洲領導人齊聚北京參加中非合作論壇時，米斯瓦蒂國王正在主持他的年度傳統勵展舞，並選出了他的第15任妻子。 </p><p>中國國家主席習近平向非洲宣布了另外600億美元（合470億英鎊）的融資，但eSwatini表示不會錯失良機。 </p><p> “我們不希望出現這樣一種情況，即我們被認為是與美元外交相關的人。我們最重要的是外交和政治道德，”Percy

“有一些嚴重的爭論正在發生，一些後門的亞洲殖民化正在發生，它已經取代了中國大陸的面貌。” </p><p> eSwatini政府鼓勵台灣為其農村電氣化計劃和其他支持提供資金，但台灣也通過獎學金贏得了人們的心。 </p><p>當她談到她在首都台北的四年大學生時，坦德卡·德拉米尼的聲音充滿了情感，她在2017年畢業於國際商務和貿易課程的頂峰。 </p><p> “我只是一個孩子，由一個單親撫養長大。這對我很感動，因為我的母親沒有資金，所以要獲得全額資助的獎學金真的改變了我的生活。” </p><p>她現在在一家政府機構擔任顧問，並否認反對派聲稱，國王姆斯瓦蒂，王室及其周圍的精英使用他們與台灣的關係來豐富自己，而大部分人口仍然貧困。 </p><p> “當時，這裡的政府有一些財政問題，大學生沒有得到津貼，或者沒有及時支付 - 但我沒有任何問題，我母親沒有給我任何錢，“德拉米尼女士說。 </p><p>台灣駐eSwatini大使館 - 非洲唯一的大使館 - 禮貌地拒絕了採訪要求，但其大使在去年9月給斯威士蘭時報編輯的一封信中讚揚了雙方的雙邊關係。 </p><p> “毫無疑問，正如非洲，巴爾乾和南亞國家迅速發現的那樣，中國的債務陷阱外交是貧困和奴役的單程票。它也是永遠放棄主權的必然方式，

1895年，在日本第一次抗日戰爭勝利之後，清政府別無選擇，只能將台灣割讓給日本。 </p><p>但是在第二次世界大戰之後，中國共和國 - 其中一個勝利者 - 在日本投降並放棄對中國領土的控制後，開始在其美國和英國的盟國同意的情況下統治台灣。 </p><p>然而，在接下來的幾年裡，蔣介石軍隊的領導人被毛澤東領導下的共產黨軍隊擊敗。 </p><p>江澤民和他的國民黨政府的殘餘分子於1949年逃往台灣。這個被稱為中國大陸，然後組成150萬人的群體，在台灣的政治中佔據了多年的統治地位，儘管他們只佔了台灣政府的14％。人口。 </p><p>繼承了有效的獨裁政權，面對當地人民對228大屠殺和獨裁統治的不滿，以及在日益增長的民主運動的壓力下，蔣的兒子蔣經國開始允許民主化進程，最終導致2000年選舉島上第一位非國民黨主席陳水扁。 </p><p>經過幾十年的敵意和憤怒的言論，中國與台灣的關係在20世紀80年代開始改善。中國提出了一個被稱為“一國兩制”的公式，如果台灣接受中國的統一，台灣將獲得重大的自治權。 </p><p>該提議遭到拒絕，但台灣確實放寬了對中國的訪問和投資規則。它還在1991年宣布與中華人民共和國開戰。 </p><p>儘管中國堅持認為中華民國（ROC）政府是非法的，否則雙方的非官方代表之間的談判也有限，這阻礙了政府與政府的接觸。 </p><p> 2000年，當台灣選舉公開支持獨立的陳水扁總統時，北京感到震驚。 </p><p>陳水扁於2004年再次當選，促使中國在2005年通過所謂的反分裂國家法，規定中國如果試圖脫離中國，就有權利對台灣使用“非和平手段”。 </p><p>

</p><p>中國認為台灣是一個脫離的省份，它已發誓要在必要時以武力奪回。但台灣領導人表示，這顯然不僅僅是一個省，而是認為它是一個主權國家。 </p><p>它有自己的憲法，民主選舉產生的領導人，以及大約30萬軍隊中的現役部隊。 </p><p>鑑於這兩個立場之間的巨大差異，大多數其他國家似乎樂於接受目前的模糊性，即台灣具有獨立國家的大多數特徵，即使其法律地位仍不明確。 </p><p>雖然政治進展緩慢，但兩國人民和經濟之間的聯繫急劇增加。台灣公司在中國投資了大約600億美元（合400億英鎊），現在有多達100萬台灣人居住在那裡，許多台灣工廠經營台灣工廠。 </p><p>一些台灣人擔心他們的經濟現在依賴中國。其他人指出，由於中國經濟的成本增加，更緊密的商業聯繫使中國的軍事行動不太可能發生。

2016年1月選舉對民進黨的支持有所增加。部分原因是由於對國民黨處理經濟問題的不滿，從貧富差距到高房價，部分原因是擔心馬英九政府使台灣過於依賴北京。 </p><p>美國是台灣最重要的朋友，也是唯一的盟友。 </p><p>第二次世界大戰和冷戰期間建立的這種關係經歷了1979年的最嚴峻考驗，當時總統吉米卡特結束了美國對台灣的外交承認，以便集中精力發展與中國的關係。

</p><p>由於與Mar-a-Lago安全部門的成員明顯溝通不暢，張先生最初於3月30日進入了該物業。 </p><p>據投訴，她告訴美國特勤局特工，她在那裡“去游泳池”，並出示了兩本護照。 Mar-a-Lago安全隨後承認了她。 </p><p>但是，當她不知道自己想要去哪裡時，工作人員很快就開始懷疑。她告訴接待員，那天晚上她在那裡參加一個不存在的“聯合國華裔美國人協會”活動。 </p><p>投訴稱，在代理人被告知張某的存在後，她告訴他們，她在那裡參加美國和中國之間的“聯合國友誼活動”，並製作了她所聲稱的邀請活動。但是“代理商無法像中文那樣閱讀它。”當時沒有安排在該物業發生此類事件。 </p><p>特朗普當時住在Mar-a-Lago，儘管他在張某涉嫌訪問時沒有出現在該地產上。 </p><p>在她被拘留後，經紀人發現她有多個電子設備，包括四部手機，一台筆記本電腦，一個外置“硬盤式”設備和一個拇指驅動器。 </p><p>檢察官說，初步調查發現拇指驅動器上存在惡意惡意軟件。 </p><p>週二晚，美國檢察官辦公室女發言人莎拉沙爾說，張持的兩本護照來自中華人民共和國。投訴表明他們來自中華民國，俗稱台灣。 </p><p> “向法院提供的信息表明，被告來自中華人民共和國，而非中華民國（台灣），他們是中華人民共和國護照，”Schall在一封電子郵件中說。 </p><p>當被問及此事件發生時，中國外交部發言人耿爽表示他對張某的被捕“沒有任何消息”。 </p><p>該投訴引發了許多關於張的財產目的的問題。當經紀人採訪她時，她“聲稱她的中國朋友&#39;查爾斯&#39;告訴她從中國上海前往佛羅里達州棕櫚灘參加此次活動，並試圖與總統家屬談論中美對外經濟關係，“根據投訴。 </p><p>代理商試圖了解更多有關“查爾斯”的信息，但張女士聲稱她只通過微信這一消息與他聯繫，微信是一種在中國很受歡迎的消息服務。 </p><p> “由於潛在的語言障礙問題，”投訴說，Mar-a-Lago認為她是一名成員的親戚。 </p><p>但在與代理商的訪談中，投訴指出，她“展示了詳細的知識，並且能夠交流並理解英語中甚至微妙的細微差別。” </p><p> “例如，當代理人試圖獲得書面同意審查她所擁有的電子設備時，張某用英語向代理人朗讀了整個表格，”它說。 </p><p>佛羅里達州南部地區的檢察官週一向她指控了一項向聯邦官員作出虛假陳述和一項進入受限制財產的罪名。 </p><p>週一，張在佛羅里達州聯邦法院首次亮相，她被告知對她的指控以及她所面臨的可能處罰。她將於4月8日回到法庭進行拘留聽證會。 </p><p>在周二晚些時候的一份聲明中，美國特勤局表示，Mar-a-Lago俱樂部管理層負責決定允許誰進入該物業，並指出“這種接入不能使總統或其他特勤局保護人員接近。 “ </p><p>聲明說：“雖然特勤局沒有確定誰被允許進入俱樂部，但我們的代理人和官員進行了實物檢查，以確保不允許任何違禁物品進入該物業。” </p><p>它補充說，“除了某些受到永久保護的設施，例如白宮，Mar-a-Lago使用的做法與總統或其他特勤局保護者臨時訪問的任何其他地點長期使用的做法沒有什麼不同。 。 </p><p>更正：根據刑事訴訟，這個故事已經更新，以澄清Mar-a-Lago的工作人員向張某收養了該房產，並且張告訴Mar-a-Lago的工作人員，她在那裡參加聯合國華人美國協會活動。投訴還指出，Mar-a-Lago的工作人員，而不是特勤局，認為張與俱樂部成員有關。 </p><p>這個故事也更新，以糾正張所攜帶的護照國家的歸屬。 </p><p> CNN的Kate Sullivan和Ben

</p><p>緊張局勢日益加劇</p><p>中國與新西蘭的關係是Ardern的前任一直關注培養的關係。 </p><p>在擔任領導的八年期間，Key曾六次訪問該國。在總理海倫·克拉克（Helen Clark）的領導下，2008年新西蘭成為第一個與中國簽署自由貿易協定的發達國家。 </p><p>今天，中國是新西蘭最大的貿易夥伴。據新西蘭外交和貿易部稱，2018年兩國之間的雙向貿易價值超過190億美元（280億新西蘭元）。中國也是新西蘭第二大旅遊市場和最大的國際學生來源。 </p><p>然而，惠靈頓與北京的關係引發了對新西蘭長期盟友美國的警鐘。 </p><p>新西蘭與華盛頓一起，是名為“五眼”的獨家情報共享社區的成員，該社區也包括英國，加拿大和澳大利亞。 </p><p>美國前政府分析家彼得·馬蒂斯在2018年4月向美中經濟與安全審查委員會發表的一份特別聲明中表示，鑑於新西蘭與北京的關係，應對其進行審查。 </p><p> “澳大利亞和新西蘭都面臨著中共干涉的實質性問題。在這兩種情況下，如果你願意的話，中共已經非常接近或在政治核心內部，”馬蒂斯告訴委員會。 </p><p>對於新西蘭來說，處理與美國和中國的關係變得越來越困難，兩大巨頭之間的關係正在美國總統唐納德特朗普不斷升級的貿易戰中徘徊。 </p><p>新西蘭政府通信安全局阻止中國科技公司華為向該國主要電信公司之一Spark提供5G技術，2018年北京的緊張局勢達到了新的水平。 </p><p>美國一直在向其盟國和外交夥伴施加壓力，要求華為放棄安全問題，此舉一直受到北京方面的譴責。 </p><p> Ardern的發言人安德魯•坎貝爾（Andrew Campbell）在2月份對美國有線電視新聞網（CNN）發表講話說，由於GCSB對華為的決定，這種關係遭受了一些“激怒”。 </p><p>當被問及華為是否會在本週末提上日程時，中國外交部發言人耿爽迴避了這個問題。 </p><p>後腳上的Ardern </p><p>最近幾個月，Ardern發現自己面臨來自反對派政治家和批評者的更大壓力，以捍衛新西蘭與中國關係的力量。 </p><p>今年2月，阿爾登被迫否認中國故意拖延新西蘭外交官的簽證程序，並將官員的旅行推遲到北京。 </p><p>同月，當地媒體報導，新西蘭航空公司飛往上海的航班神秘地被迫返回奧克蘭，發現其文書工作涉及有爭議的台灣島嶼。 </p><p>當時，Ardern否認這是與中國的“關係”問題，而是說這是一個行政錯誤。 </p><p>但是同一個月中國 - 新西蘭主要旅遊事件的推遲 - 這是Ardern提出的調度問題 - 也加劇了對裂痕的猜測。 </p><p>在對克賴斯特徹奇的兩座清真寺發動恐怖襲擊事件僅僅兩週之後，Ardern的行程也在新西蘭的一個敏感時刻，其中50人死亡。她甚至說她將縮短她在中國的旅行時間，因為在這樣的時間出海似乎並不合適。 </p><p>在對處理這場悲劇表示全球讚譽之後，新西蘭領導人受到人權組織的壓力，要求提出中國對習近平鎮壓維吾爾族穆斯林的問題。據美國政府報導，據報導，在新疆西部地區的拘留中心，有多達200萬維族人被拘留。 </p><p> “鑑於我以前提過它，這應該給你一個指示，”她在本週被記者問到時說道。 </p><p>在此之前，總理髮言人再次否認她擔心在她領導下與中國的關係惡化。 “中國是我們最重要和最深遠的關係之一。我們的關係是成熟和有彈性的，”發言人說。 </p><p>中國研究員楊同意官方路線。 </p><p>他說：“我認為，如果這種關係真的在惡化，那麼就會更加清晰。我認為，如果中國希望傳遞信息，中國會更加直言不諱。” </p><p>更廣泛的應變</p><p>太平洋地區 - 新西蘭長期以來一直是一個重要的參與者 - 正在逐漸成為影響力的新戰場。 </p><p>中國已經承諾在該地區提供數十億美元的援助和支持，如果這樣做，可能會超過澳大利亞成為太平洋國家的最大捐助國。 </p><p>新西蘭也在加大支出。去年，政府宣布將增加該地區的援助7.14億新西蘭元（4.84億美元），作為其“太平洋重置”戰略的一部分 - 評論員表示這至少部分是由於中國在該地區日益增長的影響力。 </p><p> “我們的眼睛對新西蘭在太平洋地區日益減少的影響力持開放態度，我們致力於重新設定與太平洋地區合作的方式，”副總理溫斯頓彼得斯去年6月表示。 </p><p>儘管有許多摩擦點，新西蘭中國委員會執行董事斯蒂芬雅各布並不感到恐慌。相反，雅各比說，最大的恐懼是新西蘭變得無關緊要。 </p><p> “現實是，我們是一個小國，中國人每天都不會想起如何為新西蘭做好事，”他說。 “這意味著我們需要謹慎對待我們的事情

</p><p>溫暖的海洋保持較少的氧氣，這使問題更加嚴重。辛普森說日本，台灣和波羅的海的一些地區由於低氧而看到魚類大量死亡。 </p><p>食品安全</p><p>辛普森說，魚類通過遷移到較涼爽的地區來應對溫暖的海洋。但是，世界上某些地區的水域對任何魚類都過於溫暖 - 這可能導致這些地區的糧食短缺。 </p><p> “熱帶地區存在嚴重的食品安全風險，”辛普森說。 “沒有物種已經被溫度升溫到熱帶地區，所以你可以看到食用魚種群的真正崩潰。這些地方沿海國家除了來自珊瑚礁的魚類外，通常沒有其他蛋白質。” </p><p>融化的海冰</p><p>溫暖的海水正在使海冰融化。海冰漂浮在海面上，所以當它融化時它不會影響海平面。但這意味著將太陽的熱量反射回太空的海冰更少，這意味著地球變暖了。 </p><p>對於依賴海冰生存的動物來說，這是個壞消息 -

Hsiao博士進行了簡短的身體檢查，發現左眼瞼瘀傷和一個如果疼痛，扭曲的左瞳孔。 </p><p>眼睛的單個開口，瞳孔是一個光線，光線通過該光線到達視網膜，一層薄薄的組織襯在眼睛的後壁上。視網膜的感光細胞將光轉換為發送到大腦後部的信號，視覺皮層匯集信息並決定所看到的內容。 </p><p>患者坐在裂隙燈後面，這樣他的醫生就可以對受傷的左眼進行更徹底的檢查。 </p><p>裂隙燈，在眼科醫生辦公室無處不在，是一種笨重的工具，需要你將下巴放在一個支撐上，並將你的前額放在另一個支撐上，同時你不舒服的近距離醫生通過顯微鏡進入你的眼睛。裂隙燈將窄帶光線聚焦到眼睛中，提供了“靈魂之窗”前後兩側的放大三維視圖。 </p><p>對患者左眼進行的第二次檢查發現虹膜“上部下垂，從9點鐘位置分離到3點位置”，陳和蕭在一份關於該男子受傷的案例研究中寫道，已發表星期三在新英格蘭醫學雜誌。 </p><p>他們在一封電子郵件中告訴美國有線電視新聞網，這樣的虹膜分離“會導致多個瞳孔，導致單眼複視，模糊視力或畏光”（無法忍受光線）。 </p><p>那麼是什麼造成了罕見的傷害？人們用來將貨物綁在摩托車上的橡皮筋將他直接撞到了眼睛裡。 </p><p>虹膜是“我們認為是眼睛的有色部分，”休斯敦UTHealth的麥戈文醫學院眼科學和視覺科學教授Nicholas P. Bell博士解釋說。 </p><p> “虹膜中的肌肉會導致瞳孔打開或關閉，以控制在不同環境光照條件下光線進入眼睛的程度，類似於調整相機鏡頭上光圈的方式，”貝爾說，他沒有對此進行治療。特別耐心。在一個黑暗的房間裡，瞳孔打開，讓更多的光線進入，在晴天，瞳孔將收縮以減少入射光量。 </p><p>雖然Chen和Hsiao沒有看到白內障，視網膜損傷或晶狀體脫位的證據，但虹膜與其後面肌肉的分離很容易導致患者的模糊和雙重視力。這種損傷稱為創傷性虹膜透析。 </p><p>貝爾說這種情況“相對不常見”，但確實發生這種情況時，體育或與工作有關的活動往往是原因。但還有其他人。 “由於局部集中的強力，蹦極和安全氣囊損傷似乎更常導致創傷性虹膜透析，”貝爾說，並補充說安全氣囊可以挽救生命，並且擔心這種極為罕見的眼睛傷害是沒有理由避免它們。 </p><p> USC Roski眼科研究所的醫學主任兼南加州大學凱克醫學院臨床眼科副教授J. Martin Heur博士同意這種傷害“非常罕見，但我有一小撮人”他們發生了這件事。“ “創傷可能是由任何不能穿透眼睛的東西引起的”，但仍會導致“虹膜像那樣撕裂根部，”Heur說，他沒有參與這名患者的護理。他說，像高爾夫球這樣的球可能是罪魁禍首。 </p><p>為了修復損傷，台灣病人接受了手術，恢復了瞳孔形狀並改善了視力。 </p><p> Heur說，這種稱為虹膜成形術的手術“通常在手術室完成”，“相對較短：約30分鐘”。該程序涉及McCannel縫線，基本上當外科醫生小心地將虹膜縫合回眼睛的內壁時。 </p><p></p><p> Heur補充說，在進行虹膜成形術後，患者必須小心一兩個星期左右，以解除抬高的物體或吸入水分。一旦癒合，需要定期監測患者的生命，因為青光眼甚至可在傷後數年發展。 </p><p>陳和蕭說，一年後，台灣病人的虹膜仍然只有“輕度畸形”。雖然到目前為止還沒有青光眼的證據，但患者現在戴著眼鏡幫助他在受傷的眼睛中達到20/50的視力：他需要在20英尺內才能看到健康視力的人能夠在50英尺處看到什麼。 </p><p>斯坦福大學拜爾斯眼科研究所教授兼眼科教授杰弗里戈德伯格博士說，他看到一名同樣嚴重的傷病“在一名漁民將一根鋼索扣回眼中後。” </p><p> “因為眼外傷的一些影響可以是無症狀的，並且出現在四到六週後，重要的是在嚴重創傷後立即與專業眼科醫生進行完整的眼科檢查，一兩個月後才能安全，戈德伯格說，他沒有對待這位台灣病人。 </p><p>雖然這種程度的損傷是罕見的，但“不太嚴重的虹膜透析會更常發生中度至重度眼外傷，”他說。當虹膜的最邊緣出現小眼淚時，它們會“導致該區域留下疤痕，隨後阻塞眼睛的流失，導致更高的眼壓和青光眼。” </p><p>猶他大學John A.

以及國民黨最終為2/28道歉？ </p><p> 1945年日本在第二次世界大戰中投降後，蔣介石的部隊佔領了台灣，並將其稱為中華民國，後者包括今天中華人民共和國的大部分領土。蔣介石國民黨為製服這個島嶼而採取的嚴厲措施，不足為奇地遭遇了抵抗。 1947年2月27日，當警方襲擊一名非法出售香煙的寡婦時，緊張局勢爆發。爆發了大規模的抗議活動。第二天，國民黨士兵向群眾開槍。 </p><p>蔣介石政府否認在毛澤東的軍隊將國民黨從中國大陸驅逐出去之後很久就發生了大屠殺並堅持這一立場。 </p><p>在大屠殺發生30週年之際，公眾對這一事件的清算似乎不比今天對天安門事件的全面調查更有可能。但那改變了。 </p><p>台灣的過去，中國的未來</p><p>儘管只有一個大屠殺可以在其發生的地方公開討論，但有三種方式可以考慮2/28的遺產有助於將6/4的大屠殺納入其中。 </p><p>首先，通過表明威權體系的歷史經常出現意想不到的變化。 </p><p>在中國長期放鬆鎮壓的希望已經證明是空想的。中共非常有彈性。但台灣的情況提醒我們，即使是彈性物體也會破裂。 </p><p>中華民國幾十年來一直處於戒嚴狀態。直到1979年，國民黨還在台灣第二大城市高雄市用武力粉碎民主抗議者。然而，在20世紀80年代，民主活動家以充滿活力的態度宣稱自己讓許多觀察者感到意外，而在1986年，蔣介石的兒子和繼承人蔣經國意外地改變了他父親的政策並允許正式建立反對黨。戒嚴最終於1987年結束。 </p><p>其次，多種力量可以推動變革。 </p><p>政治活動家，長期官員和其他演員在台灣民主化中發揮了重要作用。這表明有必要避免讓中國國家主席習近平目前強調控制能夠引起近視。即使一個自信的強人站在最頂層，也值得關注表面下冒泡的力量。 </p><p>第三，改變是一個漫長的過程。 </p><p>值得記住的是，中華民國直到1996年才首次進行直接的總統選舉。其第一位非國民黨主席直到2000年才當選。 </p><p>台灣的歷史並沒有告訴我們在不久的將來會在中國發生什麼，但它確實讓我們有理由希望政策 - 包括6/4如何被記住和討論 - 最終能夠改變。 </p><p>剩下的問題是如何以及何時？ </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410130650-tiananmen-square-1989-64-banner-story-body.jpg','[\"221\", \"236\", \"264\"]',0),(113,3,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/asia/taiwan-terry-gou-foxconn-president-intl/index.html','一位女神激勵台灣億萬富翁效仿特朗普的榜樣','null','“郭台銘是中國經濟中不可或缺的一員，成為總統將使他能夠以Tsai所反對的方式將台灣與中國經濟緊密聯繫在一起，例如她的新南行政策試圖將台灣的貿易擴展到中國之外，”納赫曼說。','By James Griffiths, CNN','2019-04-18T06:09:17Z',1555567757000,'<p> （美國有線電視新聞網）台灣最富有的人，其公司以在中國製造iPhone而聞名，他已經投入到島上即將舉行的總統競選中。 </p><p>據國家媒體報導，電子製造業巨頭富士康董事長郭台銘週三表示，海神女神媽祖告訴他“向台灣人民挺身而出”。 </p><p>據該公司稱，如果他贏得初選，被選為國民黨總統候選人，那麼估計淨資產為80億美元的郭台銘將在富士康（Fox Hain）“退出日常運營”，如果他贏得初選。 </p><p>富士康是全球最大的電子產品製造商，為Apple，華為等提供配件。這家台灣公司在中國擁有龐大的業務，在那裡僱傭了數十萬人，並於2017年承諾在威斯康星州建立一家工廠，以換取40億美元的州和地方稅收優惠政策。 </p><p>如果被選中，郭台銘可能會在1月11日舉行的2020年大選中面對現任台灣總統蔡英文。 </p><p> Tsai宣布她打算在今年2月舉行，因為在2018年地方選舉失敗後，她的民主進步黨（DPP）在全島範圍內大肆流行。 </p><p>民進黨傳統上贊成將台灣事實上的獨立從中國正式化的舉措。自從她在2016年掌權以來，Tsai一直試圖使該島的經濟多樣化，使其過於依賴其大鄰居，同時又反對她所認為的北京侵略性擴張主義。 </p><p>反過來，北京加大了對台灣的壓力，在島上進行大規模軍事演習，包括在遼寧航空公司通過台灣海峽航行。中國國家主席習近平在1月份發表講話，敦促台灣接受與中國的“和平統一”，稱獨立是“死胡同”。 </p><p>如果他成為總統，郭台銘可能會受到修復這種關係的挑戰，同時保持台灣與華盛頓的傳統強關係。 </p><p>由於能夠做到這一點，他將比許多候選人有更好的要求 - 富士康通過深入參與中國經濟而賺取了數十億美元，其中許多製造工廠都以此為基礎，為許多美國科技公司生產電子產品，尤其是蘋果公司。 </p><p>郭台銘自己也與美國有著緊密的聯繫，並會見了美國總統唐納德特朗普，他稱他為“我的朋友”和“世界上最成功的商人之一”。 </p><p>中國共產黨的喉舌“人民日報”週三表示，“郭台銘在處理台灣與大陸和美國關係方面具有獨特的優勢。” </p><p>台灣將於2020年1月11日選出下一任總統。 </p><p>來自女神的祝福</p><p>本週，郭台銘參觀了台北的一座寺廟後，宣布了他的候選資格，這座寺廟專門為海員的守護天使Mazu to Maist de Maity。 </p><p>身穿鮮紅色背心和棒球帽，上面顯示了中華民國國旗 - 台灣的官方名稱 - 郭台銘說，媽祖給了她的候選資格。 </p><p> “如果媽祖說你應該加強，那不是為了賺錢或個人享受，”郭台銘告訴記者。 “我告訴你，我就像媽祖的教子......我一定會尊重並遵循媽祖的意志。” </p><p>稍後在國民黨總部講話 - 仍然戴著帽子 - 郭台銘說他“願意參加初選”。 </p><p> “我不願意接受任命（沒有當選），我絕對不願意接受被任命。如果當選，我將代表國民黨參加2020年的比賽，”他說。 “如果我不當選，那就意味著我沒有努力。” </p><p>富士康在一份聲明中表示，郭台銘只會競選總統，“如果主要進程 - 仍由黨內領導層決定 - 是公開，透明和堅定的。” </p><p> “如果做出這樣的決定，郭台銘將在國民黨的初選中競選總統的黨內提名，”一位女發言人說。 </p><p>和Mazu一樣，Gou可能受到另一個來源的啟發：特朗普。據多家媒體報導，據傳富士康董事長受到特朗普2016年競選的啟發，並開始認為他也可能擔任總裁。 </p><p>塞頓霍爾大學法學院的台灣專家瑪格麗特劉易斯將郭台銘的候選資格與特朗普的候選人進行了比較，並警告不要低估這位台灣億萬富翁。 </p><p> “雖然他作為候選人在很多方面顯然存在缺陷，但民粹主義可能是強大的，”她說。 “對他的跑步過於輕鬆是錯誤的。” </p><p>雖然郭台銘肯定是一個局外人候選人 - 根據官方媒體報導，自2000年以來他一直不是國民黨的成員 - 他得到了關鍵黨派人士的支持，前領導人和台灣總統馬英九說他是“理想的候選人。” </p><p>加州大學歐文分校台灣政治專家列夫·納赫曼說，郭台銘特別關注國民黨需要的資金：資金。 </p><p> “郭台銘是台灣最富有的商人之一，基本上可以資助自己的競選活動，”他說。 “現在對國民黨來說這是一件大事。” </p><p></p><p>來自北京的支持？ </p><p>儘管曾經與共產黨就中國統治內戰 - 在失敗迫使中華民國政府撤退到台灣之前 - 國民黨近幾十年來一直是與北京建立更緊密聯繫和接觸的政黨。 </p><p>馬英九前總統在2015年與中國的習近平舉行了歷史性會談，他的政府大規模加強了兩岸經濟活動，其中包括一場引發大規模抗議活動的有爭議的貿易協議，該協議被稱為向日葵運動，被認為有助於將蔡和她的民進黨運送到總統。 </p><p>郭台銘與中國的聯繫是多方面的。他的公司富士康在中國的工廠和製造工廠僱傭了數十萬人。 </p><p> “郭台銘是中國經濟中不可或缺的一員，成為總統將使他能夠以Tsai所反對的方式將台灣與中國經濟緊密聯繫在一起，例如她的新南行政策試圖將台灣的貿易擴展到中國之外，”納赫曼說。 </p><p>然而，富士康也可能成為選民關注的焦點。 </p><p>到目前為止，該公司一直對苟先生競選總統對他與其創立的公司的關係的確切意義一直守口如瓶。 </p><p>一位女發言人表示，目前郭台銘仍然擔任主席，並將在尋求國民黨提名時“繼續提供戰略指導和指導”。 </p><p> “這是百萬美元的問題。誰是苟？忠誠？台灣？富士康？兩者？如果答案是富士康或者兩者兼而有之，那麼由於富士康的成功與強制與否有關，台灣處於不利位置中國國家，“納赫曼說。 </p><p> “就同樣的方式，特朗普在擔任總統期間只是略微從他的資產中剝離出來，我不會指望郭台銘真正離開他的（公司），”他補充說。 </p><p> “我會非常擔心郭台銘將其業務與政治努力分開的能力。鑑於富士康在中國經濟中的地位和郭台銘的政治理想，我不確定他是否能夠或想要。” </p><p>塞頓霍爾教授路易斯也告誡不要假設郭台銘或任何其他國民黨總統能夠神奇地修復與北京的關係。 </p><p> “馬英九與習近平會面，但我認為將2013年的習近平與2019年的習近平進行比較是不公平的，”她說。 “近年來，他已經能夠採取更加自信的立場。” </p><p>他能贏嗎？ </p><p>郭台銘一再表示，他不想簡單地被任命為國民黨候選人，並將與該黨的初選作鬥爭。 </p><p>對於這位億萬富翁來說，這可能是一個緊密的選擇，其他多位候選人和潛在的候選人，包括韓國居民，他自己以前所說的韓國宇將是一位“非常棒”的總統。 </p><p>漢族是南方城市高雄的一位非常受歡迎的國民黨市長，尚未正式宣布他的候選人資格，但最近幾週被視為該黨最終選秀的領跑者。他最近訪問了美國，與立法者和商界領袖會面，這是宣布競選總統的傳統第一步。 </p><p> “韓國語是一個非常有趣，不尋常的人，”劉易斯說。 “他還沒有製定明確的政策，更加華麗，&#39;即使你不知道那是什麼&#39;，我也會有所不同。” </p><p>作為高雄市長，韓已經加強了與中國的接觸，並且預計將採取類似於道路的道路，劉易斯將其描述為“一般願意與中國接觸，特別是經濟上，並且相信這種接觸可以局限於經濟。” </p><p> “漢族目前在台灣目前擁有無與倫比的人氣，”納赫曼說。 “韓也表示，特別是在他最近一次訪問香港期間，他和郭台銘一樣願意與中共建立牢固的聯繫，並推動更加統一的議程。” </p><p>由於郭台銘和漢族都讚成與中國建立更緊密的聯繫，納赫曼表示，他們最終可能會在一張可能在國民黨和台灣內部重塑政治的票上盡可能少地合作。 </p><p>他表示，“那將是最明顯地支持總統領導的最明顯的支持統一的團隊。” “正如我們所知，它可能會導致目前現狀的終結。” </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190417234154-0417-terry-gou-02-story-body.jpg','[\"21\", \"156\", \"241\"]',0),(114,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/03/23/tsai-ing-wen-taiwans-president-is-challenged-by-a-former-underling','台灣總統蔡英文受到前任下屬的挑戰','沒有任何一位尋求連任的人不得不在此之前與小學打架','這場比賽可能會激怒中國，因為賴先生比蔡女士更有聲稱支持台灣應該正式宣布自己是一個與中國截然不同的國家 -

台灣社會已經有很多分歧。此外，市政選舉於11月24日臨近。他們將考驗蔡女士的領導，民進黨希望避免爭議。除了希望台灣宣布與中國正式分離外，它在該島南部的傳統基地更古老，更保守。 </p><p>反同性戀勢力抓住了機會。民進黨通過的一項法律使得公民投票更容易投票：選民在11月24日面臨至少十個問題。有人詢問是否應該在小學和中學禁止討論LGBT問題。它旨在回滾那些教導同性戀學生尊重和理解的國家課程。第二部分詢問選民是否認為民法應該將婚姻定義為男女之間。第三個問題是，同性伴侶組成永久性工會的權利是否應該以民事婚姻以外的形式得到保障。 </p><p>同性戀活動家們已經回擊了他們自己的兩次公民投票 - 一個問題是學校課程是否應該規定LGBT問題的教育，另一個詢問是否應該在民法典中規定同性權利。 </p><p>目前尚不清楚公民投票的結果是如何具有約束力的（它們也可能證明是矛盾的，這將是尷尬的）。法院已經明確表示，如果政府沒有及時立法，同性伴侶可能會繼續結婚。但保守黨的目標是改變氣候，台灣促進民事合作權利聯盟的Victoria Hsu說：例如，教師可能會因為談論同性戀問題而感到緊張。同性戀婚姻的反對者也希望讓政府為同性戀夫婦建立一種獨特的婚姻形式，而不是修改現有的婚姻法。但對於同性婚姻的支持者來說，對同性戀者的單獨立法將具有歧視性。他們把它比作曾經強制種族隔離的美國吉姆克勞法律。 </p><p>亞洲其他地區正在關注台灣。香港有一個充滿活力的公民社會和對同性戀的日益開放。自7月法院作出裁決以來，政府承認在國外進行居留和其他目的的外國同性伴侶的婚姻。此舉得到了企業和律師事務所的支持，他們擔心香港吸引國際人才的能力。正如美國一樣，曾在多個國家爭取婚姻平等的埃文·沃爾夫森說，這可能會證明朝著允許香港同性伴侶結婚的方向邁出了一步。 </p><p>在香港之後，日本是唯一一個不承認同性結合的G7國家。 9月，五個外國商會呼籲婚姻平等，支持有影響力的跨國公司的呼籲。執政的自由民主黨的一位女議員今年夏天寫道，LGBT夫婦因為沒有復製而“沒有生產力”。但其他執政黨政客更加開放。越來越多的人認為東京在2020年舉辦的奧運會可能成為日本支持婚姻平等的一個線索。這將使日本自己登上領獎台。 </p>',NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687281','[\"102\", \"239\", \"79\"]',0),(118,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/06/14/china-fights-taiwan-on-airline-websites','中國在航空公司網站上與台灣作戰','與此同時，美國用實體加強與台灣的聯盟','然而，要判斷中國官員多少譴責美國外交官和國會議員誰將要出席在台灣首都舉行的儀式，中國似乎關心美國在台灣的行動，而不是關於朝鮮半島的地緣政治競爭。 。','','2018-06-14T15:09:16Z',1528988956000,'<p>總統唐納德特朗普與朝鮮獨裁者金正恩（Kim Jong Un）舉行首腦會議的所有喧囂，在同一天在台北新任美國大使館的同一天開幕，從來都不會成為頭條新聞。然而，要判斷中國官員多少譴責美國外交官和國會議員誰將要出席在台灣首都舉行的儀式，中國似乎關心美國在台灣的行動，而不是關於朝鮮半島的地緣政治競爭。 。 </p><p>自1979年美國與台灣建交以向中國開放以來，其“一個中國政策”一直是與中國打交道的基石。這意味著從來沒有把台灣稱為一個國家，並且總是“承認”中國和台灣都認為只有一個中國，即使雙方對這個定義持不同意見。軟糖讓美國與台灣保持密切的非官方關係。中國很少出現在美國在台北的非官方代表處，即台灣的美國研究所（AIT）。很長一段時間，它被安置在一個陰暗的前軍事建築中，位於城市的一個不起眼的地方。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>相比之下，新建築於6月12日亮相，是內湖花哨區的設計標誌。它耗資2.5億美元。它的外觀，氣味和感覺就像一個正式的大使館。其近500名工作人員中的大部分都是美國外交官，儘管他們是臨時離開國務院。它簽發簽證。特朗普政府考慮派遣海軍陸戰隊來守衛它。 </p><p>對於希望每個人都像台灣一樣行事的中國來說，這座新建築物具有挑釁性。因此，台灣旅遊法案也是一項立法，由國會一致通過，並於3月由特朗普簽署，鼓勵美國和台灣官員之間的交流。中國強調，開幕式上的高級官員將危及貿易談判以及對朝鮮的合作。中國的噩夢是特朗普的國家安全顧問約翰博爾頓出席了會議。他呼籲美國“重新審視”一個中國的政策。 </p><p>在這種情況下，政府保持開放低調，只是為了不分散新加坡峰會的注意力。美國最高級官員是瑪麗·羅伊斯（Marie Royce），她是一位助理國務卿（也是親台灣國會議員的配偶）。在訴訟過程中，美國事實上的大使Kin Moy在一張裝滿水果和鮮花然後點燃香火的桌子前鞠躬三次。 “我向你提供這座[建築]，這是美國留在這裡的一個有形象徵，”莫伊先生告訴蔡英文總統和各位嘉賓。 AIT主席James Moriarty將民主台灣描述為“印度太平洋地區的典範”，並承諾美國將繼續支持“台灣自衛能力”。特朗普先生已經批准了14億美元的軍售。 </p><p>毫無疑問，中國將建築物的99年租約視為又一次挑釁。習近平最近授予自己無限期租約中國總統的權利，堅稱台灣回歸祖國不能永遠等待。但是，現在中國是否會對台灣進行鬥爭是另一回事。目前尚不清楚特朗普先生是否關心這個島嶼，除非是與中國進行貿易談判的典當。據說他批評國務院支持台灣的言論使他與習近平的交往復雜化。他並沒有派博爾頓先生。美國智庫戰略與國際研究中心的Bonnie Glaser估計，中國的焦慮程度越來越低。 </p><p>然而，蔡女士的壓力只會增加。自兩年前上任以來，中國已將台灣置於狗舍。雖然她不顧一切地反對，但她不會承認台灣是中國的一部分。她沒有譴責她自稱是“台獨工人”的總理威廉賴清德。 </p><p>台灣海峽的官方關係被凍結。中國否認台灣在世界衛生組織等國際論壇上佔有一席之地。它欺負國際航空公司和酒店集團將該國稱為中國的一個地區。 4月，它進行了有史以來在南海進行的最大規模的海軍演習，隨後在台灣海峽進行了實彈演習。中國轟炸機圍繞這個島嶼。與此同時，外交盟友也在剝離。 5月，多米尼加共和國和布基納法索改變立場，只留下18個承認台灣的國家。 </p><p>但是。中國關閉台灣的外交空間越多，蔡女士對非官方外交的創造性使用就越多。她的“新南方政策”試圖與東南亞鄰國及其他鄰國建立更深厚的關係，包括那些因與中國在南中國海領土爭端而陷入爭端的人。 （台灣也聲稱擁有大部分海洋，但對此卻不那麼咄咄逼人。） </p><p>該政策的範圍很廣，從促進旅遊業到緩解農民工的困境到投資製造業（例如，台灣在越南投資方面遠遠領先於中國）。對印度洋 -

南方城市高雄的控制權，該城市已經統治了20年。結果似乎是災難性的，以至於蔡女士覺得有必要辭去民進黨領導的職務。她受歡迎的總理也提出辭職，但她表示反對。 “我是那個需要改變的人，”她於11月26日在Facebook上宣稱。 </p><p>民進黨議員羅志成認為蔡女士立即進行了太多改革。 “總統非常理想主義，不現實，”羅先生說。 “她認為越多越好。”她戲劇性地削減了不可持續的公共養老金，這使許多公務員疏遠了。她凍結並在許多情況下沒收了國民黨的資產，理由是它在近40年的獨裁統治期間不公平地獲得了他們作為執政黨。她推動了一項法律，到2025年逐步淘汰核電，令依賴廉價穩定電力的工業家們驚慌失措。 </p><p>此外，羅先生補充說，在解決兩極分化問題時，蔡女士有時會激怒雙方，尋找中間地帶。她限制了正常的工作時間，讓現在不得不支付更多加班費的老闆感到不安，同時也減少了公眾假期的數量，激怒了普通工人。她在同性戀婚姻合法化方面猶豫不決，她在競選期間一直支持同性婚姻，並將其交給法院解決此事。儘管她通過拒絕肯定中國和台灣都是同一個國家的一部分來激怒中國，但她一直小心翼翼地不做任何其他事情來挑起它，以及獨立活動家的憤怒。 </p><p>蔡女士任職期間的GDP增長率從2016年的1.4％上升到今年預計的2.7％。但這還不足以消除經濟停滯的感覺，再加上蔡女士當選後中國旅遊業的突然收縮。年輕的台灣人繼續移民到大陸尋找更多的機會，往往被慷慨的官方撥款所誘惑。目前台灣勞動力中約有十分之一生活在中國。 </p><p>中國不支持支持國民黨。在蔡女士當選後，它切斷了與國民政府的所有官方聯繫，但與國民黨運營的城市保持著聯繫。在競選期間，它通過戰艦和軍用飛機停止了對島嶼周圍巡邏的恐嚇，因為這種武力表現往往激起了台灣人的民族主義情緒，推動了民進黨。台灣政府指責中國在社交媒體上傳播虛假謠言以幫助國民黨。國民黨盛行的地區，如高雄，預計會有大量中國遊客湧入，中國農產品出口激增。 </p><p>但羅先生認為，將結果視為與中國建立更密切關係的做法是錯誤的。投票的公投直接觸及了兩岸關係，詢問該國是否應該要求在奧運會上被稱為台灣，而不是中國台北。結果是含糊不清的：該提案遭到拒絕，但只是在奧運會當局警告可能導致台灣在2020年被排除在東京奧運會之後。民進黨並沒有支持這一想法，這只是一種偏離蔡女士試圖避免的現狀。 </p><p>此外，國民黨仍處於混亂狀態。它在高雄的候選人韓國宇被證明擁有真正的明星力量。但他是一個局外人，最初由領導層作為一個沒有笨蛋的人。該黨沒有明顯的總統候選人。 </p><p>民進黨中的一些人甚至在投票中的其他九個公投問題上看到了一線希望，其中沒有一個是黨的方式。選民們批准了幾項對同性戀權利持敵對態度的措施，這使政府難以履行最高法院關於使同性婚姻合法化的禁令。他們還拒絕了蔡女士關閉台灣核電站的計劃。但正是民進黨捍衛了直接民主的理念。希望有一天能夠吸收台灣的中國當局必須討厭先例。 </p>',NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250688031','[\"80\", \"177\", \"160\"]',0),(120,4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/04/05/taiwan-is-again-becoming-a-flashpoint-between-china-and-america','台灣再次成為中美之間的爆發點','與貿易和朝鮮的緊張局勢不同，它涉及雙方的紅線','儘管兩年前蔡英文選舉以來台灣對台灣的外交和軍事壓力增大，但中國並沒有被逗樂，這無疑激發了美國的立場。','','2018-04-05T14:51:07Z',1522939867000,'<p>如果美國政治的黨派關係使你感到不安，那麼請從國會兩院通過的一小部分立法中汲取靈感，而不是一票反對。雖然“台灣旅遊法案”可能在沒有總統簽名的情況下通過法律，但上個月唐納德·特朗普選擇將心電圖描繪成亂畫。鑑於華盛頓的混亂，該法案揭示了一個非凡的共識。它敦促，雖然它沒有強制要求，美國和台灣之間的高級別訪問是歷屆政府勸阻的，以免冒犯中國。 </p><p>這個國家的“一個中國原則”規定台灣是中國祖國不可分割的一部分。中國政府希望所有其他國家表現得好像台灣屬於它。自從1979年與台灣斷絕外交關係以便與中國建立外交關係以來，美國從未同意這一提法。很明顯台灣是一個朋友，長期以來一直提供軍事支持。但是，在尊重中國的情況下，美國的政策從來就沒有把台灣稱為一個單獨的國家，而且總是“承認”中國和台灣都同意只有一個中國的原則，即使雙方在這個問題上存在分歧。手段。 </p><p></p><p>升級您的收件箱並獲取我們的每日調度和編輯推薦。 </p><p>這是美國的“一個中國政策”。當台灣首都北京和台北的獨裁統治統治全中國時，制定了方便的不真實，其副作用是加深台灣的外交孤立。台灣今天沒有這樣的自命不凡。許多國會議員長期以來一直希望在過去三十年中為和平轉變為繁榮的民主而給予該島更多的信譽。 “台灣旅行法”誕生於此之外。它甚至接近稱之為鐵鍬，台灣是一個主權國家：“美國內閣成員和其他高級官員對一個國家的訪問是美國與這個國家之間關係的廣度和深度的一個指標。 ，“一個條款讀到。本週，蔡英文總統對該法案在台北的國會贊助商表示歡迎。 </p><p>更令人驚訝的是特朗普先生的支持。確實，作為2016年末的當選總統，他接受了Tsai女士的祝賀電話。這引起了華盛頓中國觀察家們的心悸。但特朗普先生很快重申了一個中國的政策。他在最喜歡的電視頻道告訴主持人，如果沒有先諮詢中國統治者習近平，他就不會在台灣做任何事情。他隨後與習近平發展的關係一直是對獨裁者權力和風格的欽佩。特朗普先生所說或所做的一切都沒有表明對台灣的欽佩。 </p><p>然而，各種各樣的轉變正在進行中。今年1月，一位親台灣的中國鷹人蘭德爾施里弗負責五角大樓的亞太政策。更為突出的鷹派約翰博爾頓即將成為特朗普先生的國家安全顧問。三月份，國務院負責印度太平洋戰略的官員亞歷克斯·黃在台北發表演講。他說，台灣“再也不能被國際論壇不公正地排除在外。 [它]與世界有很多共同之處。“由於台灣禁止從國際民用航空組織到國際刑警組織等所有事項，黃先生有一個觀點。他向蔡女士保證，美國對台灣的支持從未如此強烈。 </p><p>儘管兩年前蔡英文選舉以來台灣對台灣的外交和軍事壓力增大，但中國並沒有被逗樂，這無疑激發了美國的立場。訪問北京的貴賓被告知，旅行法所鼓勵的那種交流可能會越過紅線，因此比習近平面臨的另外兩大挑戰更危險。首先是核朝鮮周圍的微妙峰會。第二是美國對中國出口和中國第一產業政策的攻擊日益增加 -  4月3日，特朗普政府宣布對500億美元的中國商品徵收25％的關稅，從機車到吹雪機（見文章）。 </p><p>中國駐華盛頓大使館李克新警告特朗普先生不要簽署旅行法案。去年，他試圖欺負國會，廢除國防授權法案，該法案授權（但同樣不要求）美國海軍艦艇在台灣港口停靠。 “美國海軍艦艇抵達高雄的那一天是我們人民解放軍用軍隊統一台灣的那一天，”他在12月的一次招待會上大聲疾呼。習近平上個月曾警告說，任何“分裂中國”的行動都將面臨“歷史的懲罰”。這些威脅在台灣產生了一些影響。甚至連蔡女士獨立傾向的民進黨也因為有多少支持來實施旅行法案而分歧。蔡女士本人對於擾亂中國本能地持謹慎態度。很少有台灣人希望他們的國家成為一個偉大的權力遊戲中的棋子。 </p><p>今年夏天，當美國在台北開設一座閃閃發光的大樓以容納其非官方大使館時，有一個測試，傳聞內閣成員可能會參加。博爾頓的存在可能會真正地警告中國。或者，它可能會解釋特朗普政府在台灣的步驟僅僅是對貿易壓力的支柱。習近平的最高經濟官員劉和正就中國與美國貿易順差的巨大談判展開激烈談判。據推測，習近平有權提出削減數百億美元的盈餘，以避免全面的貿易戰。 </p><p>但是，如果中國認為美國在此之後繼續改變台灣的現狀呢？幾年前，習近平表示台灣“問題”不能留給子孫後代。現在他抓住了所有的權力槓桿，民族主義者如果不用它們阻止台灣滑倒，就會嚴厲地評判他。所以島上再次提出安全議程 -

台灣也希望每艘成本超過10億美元;整個年度國防預算僅為110億美元。金錢更加緊張，因為台灣正在取消徵兵並轉向全志願軍。由於受薪士兵價格較高，他們的人數較少。自1996年中國兩岸肌肉發達以來，台灣軍隊已經減少了超過15萬人，留下了21.5萬人。該國的後備力量，即其第二道防線，也將逐年萎縮。政治家們說，即便如此，任何強制入伍的回歸都將是選舉自殺。 </p><p>美國的武器，即使是大而昂貴的武器，與豪豬的理念不一致，也是一種外交目的。美國參與戰爭可能是台灣生存和滅絕之間的差異。根據智庫蘭德公司（RAND Corporation）的計算機模擬，在戰鬥的第一周，只有8艘美國潛艇可以淹沒中國40％的兩棲艦隊。 </p><p>雖然美國與台灣沒有外交關係，但它保持著密切的聯繫。每年約有3,500-4,000名五角大樓官員前往台灣，平均每天超過10人。自2010年以來，軍售總額已超過150億美元。這種關係在某些方面正在加深。武器轉讓以前捆綁成大包裝，可以引起中國人的憤怒;他們現在越來越常規了。 </p><p>唐納德特朗普的政府與高級官員在一起，他們很了解台灣，並對其困境表示同情。特朗普先生在擔任當選總統時與蔡女士進行了一場禁忌的電話會議，令台灣領導人感到高興。去年，他還簽署了“台灣旅遊法”，鼓勵美國高級官員訪問該島，反之亦然。如果武器銷售有助於支持美國對台灣的承諾，那就更好了。 </p><p>儘管習近平明顯感到有義務繼續追捕台灣的統一，但他迄今為止已經避免制定了堅實的時間表。中國兩棲艦隊相對緩慢的增長令人懷疑中國人民解放軍是否正在準備入侵。也沒有進行大型兩棲演習。台灣還有時間磨礪它的羽毛筆。 </p><p>更正（2019年1月24日）：這篇文章的原始版本說，平均每天有超過100名五角大樓官員前往台灣。我們的數學讓我們失望。來自五角大樓的每日訪客數量“超過十”。這已得到糾正。 </p>',NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687646','[\"215\", \"221\", \"151\"]',0),(123,4,'https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/03/12/inside-taiwans-new-digital-democracy','台灣內部新的數字民主','台灣數字部長奧德麗唐說，公眾對話和合作至關重要','“在世界正在重新思考治理的基本要素的時候，台灣的數字民主 -

</p><p>陳說：“我對結果並沒有感到非常積極，因為反對派利用其財政資源通過社交媒體，電視廣告和平面媒體傳播恐懼，錯誤信息，謊言和謠言來獲得支持。 </p><p> “我們擔心的是，政府將把結果作為修改法律的基礎，並可能提出一個不能完全保護我們權利的淡化立法。” </p><p>同性伴侶希望修改民法，賦予他們與異性戀者相同的權利，而不是以同性婚姻法的形式引入新的立法。 </p><p>陳是Zola的親生母親，他說：“對我們來說，最重要的是要修改民法，這樣我們才能擁有與異性戀夫妻相同的權利。我們關注的是，將通過一項單獨的法律，賦予我們民事伴侶關係的權利，但不是領養權。然後，我的妻子將無法行使我們女兒的合法養育權。“ </p><p>根據“台灣公投法”，如果該國估計有2000萬合格選民中超過25％的人讚成，“是”票數超過“不”票，那麼必須制定一項法案，以便在議會投票前反映結果。 。 </p><p>然而，分析師表示，現行法律沒有規定如果兩個相互衝突的公民投票通過將會是什麼樣的過程。 </p><p>支持權利的活動人士表示，如果蔡英文總統及其政黨早日採取行動通過2017年的裁決，就可以避免這種情況。蔡在2016年當選總統之前就爭取同性戀權利。但在教會的強烈反對下，她的政黨在這個問題上仍然存在分歧。 </p><p> “我們的法院裁定議會必須修改民法或在2019年5月24日之前引入一項新的法律，使同性婚姻合法化，”維多利亞Hsu解釋說，他是導致2017年裁決的婚姻平等案件的首席律師。 </p><p> “由於我們的政府沒有迅速作出反應，台灣的基督教會提出了三個由中央選舉委員會批准的公民投票問題。” </p><p>儘管台灣於2004年通過了一項性別平等法案，要求學校教授性別平等和多樣性，但它們包括試圖禁止小學和初中的LGBT包容性教育。 </p><p>台灣促進民事伴侶權利聯盟的聯合創始人徐先生表示，為了在這些地方選舉中保護其投票權不受保守主義權利的影響，該領導黨在同性婚姻問題上基本保持沉默。 </p><p> “他們完全理解他們不能永遠推遲這個問題，但作為政治計算的一部分猶豫不決。他們允許公投首先作為某種民意調查。“ </p><p>她說，台灣政府的行政內閣最近澄清了自己的立場，表示無論公投結果如何，同性戀婚姻都將繼續進行。 </p><p> “唯一的區別是修改民法或引入一項名為同性婚姻法的單獨法律。然而，反同性戀團體讓他們的支持者相信他們可以阻止同性戀婚姻，這是荒謬的。 </p><p> “他們花了很多錢來傳播恐懼，錯誤信息和同性戀言論。如果他們成功獲得更多選票，他們將試圖推動我們的政府通過輕量級行為與民法典相比。“ </p><p>弗吉尼亞聯邦大學社會學助理教授高英超說，保守勢力的錢和資源大約是親LGBT運動的10倍。 </p><p> “在過去的六個月裡，保守的運動產生了恐懼，焦慮，抑鬱和道德恐慌，”他說。 “有兩名LGBT成員在公投前自殺。我周圍的LGBT朋友，包括Facebook上的意見領袖，正試圖挽救生命。他們說：“即使我們失去了競選活動，請留在我們身邊，仍有希望。” </p><p> “如果你看一下可用的財務和基礎設施來調動每一方，差距是巨大的 - 但支持率相對相似。然而，最重要的決定因素將是選民投票率。“ </p><p>這個問題是分代的而不是政治的分歧，隨著台灣在20至18日的公投中首次降低投票年齡，LGBT運動將尋求城市青年的生效。 </p><p>根據婚姻平等聯盟7月份進行的一項調查，超過80％的35歲以下人口支持同性婚姻，而45歲以上的人口則為30％。 </p><p> Kao說：“這些年輕人接受過有關LGBT問題的教育，並且更多地接觸社區。如果婚姻平等獲勝，台灣將朝著一個致力於人權的成熟民主又邁出一大步。“ </p><p>與此同時，陳和蔣正在推遲計劃慶祝他們的重要日子。 “舉行婚禮是一個很好的主意，但我們對政府感到非常失望並且失去了信心，”蔣說。 </p><p> “如果修改民法，我們會急於登記為已婚夫婦，並收養我們的女兒，以建立我們的合法養育權。我們希望她能夠自由地成為自己並實現自己的夢想，因為她的母親為她的權利而奮鬥。“ </p><p> “衛報”接近了下一代聯盟的幸福評論，但沒有得到回應。

</p><p>隨著投票日臨近，保守派團體已經部署了1億台幣（250萬英鎊）的報告預算，以便將婚姻定義僅限於男女之間。發言人曾憲英表示：“家庭系統的崩潰將對社會造成巨大打擊。”下一代幸福聯盟聚集了足夠的簽名來引發公投，表達了對社會的擔憂。 </p><p>廣告覆蓋了台灣的電視廣播和報紙。錯誤的信息在社交媒體上傳播，同性婚姻反對者聲稱婚姻平等將影響該島的出生率下降，並使其成為尋求使用國家衛生系統的艾滋病毒外國人的避風港。 </p><p>另一方面，一系列名人和27家大公司，包括谷歌，微軟和IBM，都支持同性婚姻的呼籲。據當地媒體報導，在台北投票前一周，約有10萬人參加了支持婚姻平等的集會。但民意調查顯示，平等擁護者可能在民意調查中度過艱難時期。根據台灣民意基金會的統計，大約77％的人支持將婚姻定義為一男一女。 </p><p>台灣最高法院於2017年5月表示禁止同性戀夫婦結婚違反“人民的婚姻自由”和“人民的平等權”，台灣已成為亞洲第一個將同性婚姻合法化的國家。 </p><p>法院在其裁決中稱，“性取向是一種不可改變的特徵，可以抵制變革。” “兩個同性性別的婚姻自由，一旦得到法律承認，將構成集體基礎，與異性婚姻一起構成一個穩定的社會。” </p><p>該裁決要求同性婚姻在兩年內合法化。雖然根據法院的裁決，對同性伴侶的某種形式的法律承認是不可避免的，但保守派希望將其限制在民事伴侶關係而不是修改婚姻的民法典。 </p><p>作為去年增加普通公民參與政策制定的改革的一部分，政府更容易提出公民投票，將簽名數量減少到280,000個簽名 - 相當於選民的1.5％。 </p><p>這種情況導致星期六的混亂投票，共有五個與島上同性生活有關的問題，兩個有語言支持，三個有反對。其中一個問題包括國家課程中的LGBTQ材料，保守派希望禁止的內容。目前尚不清楚如果幾個相互衝突的公民投票通過將會發生什麼。 </p><p>台灣人還將就一系列其他問題進行投票，從核電和煤電使用到從日本進口的食品到奧運會競爭中使用的名稱，這可能會使台灣被禁止參加2020年東京奧運會。

“我們對台灣表演藝術的非正式性感到震驚，”荷蘭建築師Francine Houben表示，他的實踐Mecanoo（伯明翰圖書館的設計師）在2007年贏得了該項目的競爭。“中國戲曲起源於街頭劇院，所以我們想要一個讓人覺得隨意和非正式的地方，以便在公園裡觀看表演。“ </p><p>場地的氛圍更像是一個休閒中心而不是歌劇院，特別是台北的國家劇院和音樂廳，每個都建於1987年，位於首都中心廣場的兩側，就像一對來自Forbidden的皇家寺廟市。相比之下，魏武英的藝術總監錢文品希望人們從公園裡湧入劇院，把它當作自己的起居室。 “我們有超過50,000人參加我們的開放日，”他說。 “人們在某種程度上佔據了空間，沒有計劃或期待，脫鞋，做運動，躺在陰涼處，甚至在進入音樂廳時闖入歌曲。” </p><p>音樂廳擁有亞洲最大的風琴，設計為兩個竹子叢，管道超過9,000個，是一個由橡木和香檳色座椅組成的旋轉交響樂，22噸重的聲學反射器懸掛在天花板上。儘管擁有2000人的容量，但感覺非常親密，最遠的座位距指揮30米。聲學家巴黎魔術師阿爾伯特·許建立了1:10的模型，以確保它為從古典樂團到台灣原住民口琴的各種音樂提供完美的混響時間。他還在其他三個空間中施展了他的魔力，每個空間都設計有獨特的角色，並經過校準以適應各種藝術形式。 </p><p>建築師說，這座擁有434個座位的演奏廳有一個不對稱的座位佈局，“所以更多的人可以看到鋼琴家的手指”，而它的鑲板牆可以旋轉以提供不同程度的吸收，無論是舉辦更嚴酷的中國古典音樂還是爵士樂，或更柔和的巴洛克室內音樂。劇院有深藍色的座位，可以容納一個管弦樂隊到舞台的一側（對於中國歌劇來說很重要，音樂家和表演者之間必須有直接的視線）。與此同時，這座擁有2,236個座位的深紅色歌劇院位於後台，是觀眾席面積的四倍，被設想為“劇院機器”，可以同時包含五個不同節目的風景和設備。 “它比北京的歌劇更大，裝備更好，”Houben陰謀悄悄地談論民族自豪感的重要一點。 </p><p>如果禮堂是同類的典範，那麼他們之間的流通和門廳空間感覺有點像事後的想法。四個卵形場地設置成一個長225米，寬160米的矩形體積，有很多剩餘的空間，主要是用數英畝的灰色地毯，石膏板牆和吊頂天花板裝飾，每個表面塗成黑色或白色，給它一種相當暗淡，單調的感覺。在建築物內，外面起伏的廣場所承諾的空間劇很少。相反，它擁有一個具有戲劇野心的深度計劃辦公大樓。 </p><p>建築師很快指出，對於這種規模的項目，預算實際上非常緊張，這需要一些平凡的配件。雖然Jean Nouvel的Philharmonie de Paris花費了3.4億英鎊，而Herzog＆de Meuron在漢堡的Elbphilharmonie則高達6.9億英鎊（每個都有一個禮堂），Mecanoo以一小部分價格提供了四個劇院。 </p><p>堅固，粗糙和準備好的質量也適合這個嚴肅的港口城市的性質。 “我們希望它能夠詳細描述一艘貨船，而不是豪華遊艇，”Houben說，指的是建築物滾滾的白色船體的面板之間的可見鋼焊接接頭。那些沒有被告知集裝箱船典故的人可能只是認為它已經完成了，但各種航海標記加強了航海空氣。 </p><p>更大的問題是，這座擁有1600個容量劇院的300萬人口城市是否有能力定期填補這樣一個巨大的建築群。這座價值1.06億英鎊的國家台中劇院的導演是另一個雄心勃勃的洞穴式歌劇院，距離一小時的火車，由東洋伊藤於2015年建造，承認它正在努力出售其當前的瓦格納的齊格弗里德的門票。場地的開放已經消失。與此同時，台北等待由OMA設計的長期推遲的1.33億英鎊表演藝術中心的開幕，另一個劇院，音樂廳和黑匣子禮堂，以及一座驚心動魄的建築多層變壓器。 </p><p>這是一個非常豐富的場地，一個國家將在幾年內開放，所有這些場所都計劃在2000年代中期由不同的區域和國家行政當局進行。隨著中國以美元外交手段挑選台灣的盟友（現在只有17個國家認可該島是獨立的，從而取消了與中國的正式關係），文化外交似乎是它留下的為數不多的武器之一。 </p><p>如果上周威武營開幕之夜高雄的興奮程度可以接受 -

在開始新聞訪問之前，人民共和國親眼目睹了其令人印象深刻的經濟成就。在咖啡期間，我做了我認為對台灣地位的和解。那是一個錯誤。無論他是否誤解了我，他都應該以適當的威脅宣稱，對中國主張台灣主權的任何挑戰都意味著戰爭。除此之外，我們的會議取得了巨大成功。 </p><p>這是一個非常有力的提醒，說明台灣對中國政府的問題有多麼敏感。 “台灣”這個詞可以保證與任何官員發牢騷，因為我以自己的小方式發現了這一點。 </p><p>現在，習近平再次提出這個問題，這是一個有意義的“向同胞傳遞信息”40週年，這個信息促使台灣走上和平統一的道路。總統是和解的 - 但是，長期以來一直如此，如果北京的野心被台灣獨立宣言粗暴地挫敗，他拒絕排除軍事行動。 </p><p>這比大多數遙遠的領土碎片更重要，因為它是中國地緣政治冤情的一長串。雖然它對台灣的支持遠比過去弱，但美國仍然是台灣安全的保障者，因此是爭議的第三方。特朗普總統與中國的貿易戰（以及與菲律賓，越南，日本和馬來西亞之間的一系列複雜的領海爭端）也加劇了緊張局勢，並且他們已經開始相互惡化和相互影響。 </p><p>顯而易見的答案是特朗普總統和習主席以“大討價還價”解決所有這些問題。這一點的輪廓已經很明確：北京的獎項是統一，美國應該在中國提出的“一國兩制”模式下迎來台灣的統一。在20世紀90年代英國和葡萄牙交回香港和澳門時，這種模式得到了廣泛的關注。今年中國總統在革命70週年之際向他的人民介紹，這將是一件好事。 </p><p>作為回報，中國應該停止操縱人民幣並歪曲其經濟，並將其與美國仍然巨大的貿易順差消除到微不足道的水平。它還應該解決其對海岸線周圍海域的更為荒謬的主張。 </p><p>在一些環境倡議（這也將平衡經濟競爭環境），打擊知識產權盜竊以及減少中國在非洲的新殖民主義活動，以及世界可能是一個更安全，更繁榮的地方。正如尼克松和亨利基辛格在半個世紀前所承認的那樣，它也將重新擺脫其他全球超級大國俄羅斯的力量平衡。 </p><p>憑藉強大的領導者 - 特朗普和習近平至少有資格 - 這樣的交易肯定是可能的。 </p><p>而且，中國人對台灣的主張很難與之爭辯。台灣只是冷戰後的一個異常現象。中國的提議是非常明確和公平的 - 特別是如果台灣被接受為中國的一部分，因為它一直是（並且正如台灣政府曾經如此暴力地堅持）。習近平說，“在確保中國主權，安全和發展利益的基礎上，台灣的社會制度和生活方式將得到充分尊重，台灣同胞的私有財產，宗教信仰和合法權益得到充分尊重。和平統一實現後，將得到充分保護。“ </p><p>更不祥的是，和以往一樣，存在一種威脅：“我們不承諾放棄使用武力，並保留採取一切必要手段的選擇。” </p><p>自1949年毛澤東贏得內戰以來，台灣已經破壞了西方和北京之間的關係，而他的對手國民黨逃往了一些近海島嶼，其中最大的島嶼是台灣，最近被日本帝國占領。相反，十七世紀英國內戰中的一群叛徒在懷特島結束並宣稱自己是整個國家的唯一合法政府。在那個不切實際的企業中失敗了，他們現在希望宣布自己獨立。也就是說，或多或少，台灣正在發生的事情。這有點荒謬，令中國政府感到高興。 </p><p>越來越不合時宜的台灣 - 甚至現在正式稱為中華民國 - 曾經聲稱對整個國家擁有主權，並得到了好戰的美國的支持。美國拒絕承認“紅色中國”的存在，直到前冷戰戰士尼克松總統於1972年前往人民共和國進行歷史性訪問，1979年總統吉米卡特正式與北京建交。中華人民共和國當時也台灣在聯合國安理會上流離失所。 </p><p>從那以後，台灣人一直在慢慢失去外交，以及與改革，不斷發展的中國的經濟鬥爭。在毛澤東時代，中國是一個經濟侏儒;如果你消除匯率扭曲，今天它的經濟是世界上最大的經濟體。它比美國和德國的總和還要大，比英國大7倍，比台灣大20倍。人民軍有一百萬士兵。它有260枚核彈頭。外交必須考慮到這些高聳的現實。 </p><p>具有諷刺意味的是，曾經“民族主義”台灣過去常常強調中國的統一及其對整個領土的主權主張，現在北京急於重申其對台灣主權的主張，而許多台灣人則希望正式獨立。 </p><p>台灣總統蔡英文在談到她的政黨最近的挫折時，現在宣稱：“我必須強調，選舉結果絕對不意味著台灣的基層民意有利於放棄我們的主權，也不是說人們希望對台灣人的身份做出讓步。“不 - 但他們希望他們的經濟再次開始增長，而明顯的答案是與大陸的經濟統一。 </p><p> 2016年台灣選舉一位女性總統來自台灣國民黨一黨制國家歷史上不可能存在的黨派，這突顯了中國統一的新的新障礙。這是第二個諷刺：這不再是反對的專制意識形態 - 共產主義獨裁中國與資本主義獨裁中國之間的爭鬥，因為台灣現在是一個完全民主國家，中國不再是完全共產主義。放棄像台灣這樣的適當民主確實感覺不好。 </p><p>然而，正如習主席所暗示的那樣，中國在該地區的壓倒性軍事和經濟優勢確實意味著統一是不可避免的。 </p><p>歷史證明，最成功的外交倡議，那些當時看起來如此大膽和創新的外交倡議，僅僅是對不可避免的接受：尼克鬆對中國本身的歷史使命;納爾遜曼德拉和多種族南非的釋放;以色列國的存在;大英帝國的終結及其向英聯邦的轉變;蘇聯解體。歷史上的這些時刻都需要將一種失敗轉化為勝利。習近平清楚地看到了這一點，也許台灣當局也是如此。如果我們能夠確信特朗普也願意接受現實。 </p><p>在美國政府中，對中國的強硬態度似乎越來越強烈 - 去年美國副總統邁克彭斯的一個敵對言論就是一個突出的例子。西方安全部門擔心華為等中國公司的權力，並逮捕其高管。坦率地說，它變得非常危險。 </p><p>西特朗普峰會的時間和“大討價還價”。如果特朗普可以與朝鮮一起做，為什麼不是中國呢？

Predock發生爭執導致項目停滯不前。它在2010年由台北建築師Kris Yao的參與重新啟動，他繼承了一個半開始的項目，該項目提出了一些限制因素，包括人工湖上已建成的海岸線。姚先生為博物館創作了一個新設計，靈感來自中國書法的三個主要筆劃：一個厚，一個乾，一個水和塗抹。 </p><p> “這是一種非常基本的中國藝術的抽象，被翻譯成建築，”姚先生說。 </p><p>建築物的部分代表厚厚的筆劃，包含博物館的檔案和展覽區域，需要最少的自然光來保護其內容。乾燥的行程讓自然光進入，包括建築物的外骨骼，大廳和辦公室。塗抹的中風，體現穿透力，由步行區和通過湖的橋樑組成。 </p><p>受到他對古代中國青銅器的熱愛，特別是商代的青銅器的影響，姚先生說他已經將古代龍和雲圖案數字化為建築物“厚中風”部分的鱗片狀表面。 </p><p> “這不是一座建築，本身就是一種形式，”姚先生說。 “它坐落在一個完全綠色的平原上，是黑色和白色。” </p><p>博物館在嘉義蜿蜒的沿海平原上的突出地位遠離台北博物館，這是一座建在山邊的中國式宮殿。在他最近出版的“中國兩座故宮的神奇歷史”一書中，記者馬克奧尼爾寫到了蔣介石對國立故宮的要求： </p><p> “政府不僅希望傳統的中國設計與藝術作品相匹配，還希望博物館擁有最現代化的保護系統;它必須保護這些碎片不受地震，颱風，濕度，昆蟲和空襲的影響。“ </p><p>參觀台北博物館可能會讓遊客在中國廣闊的地理和歷史中感到徘徊。嘉義博物館的少數幾個展覽廳縮短了時間和空間，利用亞洲歷史悠久的商業和文化交流，這些交流本身往往是不可分割的，編織出一個既不詳盡又不費力的區域拼湊。中國的重要影響力不容忽視，也不是博物館的核心。 </p><p>以王茶為例，這是一種遍布古代亞洲貿易路線的飲料 - 王女士闡述了博物館展品的共同差異。 </p><p> “你可以將茶文化追溯到唐朝，”她說。 “抵達亞洲其他地區後，由於當地的習慣或文化而進化，”西藏人加入犛牛油或日本人研磨它來製作抹茶。 </p><p>王女士表示，為了打造世界頂級的汎亞博物館，國立故宮博物院將在世界各地的其他亞洲館藏展覽。 </p><p>例如，陶瓷大廳目前從大阪東方陶瓷博物館借用伊万裡瓷器。她說，未來的展覽將帶來東京國立博物館和九州國立博物館以及舊金山亞洲藝術博物館的日本國寶。 </p><p>來自嘉義的Teresa Chiang與她的父母和四歲的女兒一起參觀博物館，她說，她的第一次訪問讓她感覺與其他亞洲文化有更多聯繫。 “在台北博物館，你無法享受韓國或日本文化，”她說。 “在這裡你可以看到來自亞洲各地的文物 - 我覺得它太棒了。”

</p><p>在這裡搭乘公共汽車或地鐵，您可以看到兩側印有劇團舞者的照片。訪問受歡迎的淡水區，您可以一睹該公司4月份開業的2200萬美元新房屋。如果您乘坐檯灣旗艦航空公司中國航空公司（China Airlines）旅行，您甚至可以搭乘雲門飛行器（Cloud Gate Liveried Aircraft），裝飾著舞者的肖像。該航空公司去年公佈了這一說法，稱該劇團代表了“台灣文化的巔峰”。 </p><p>雲門成立於1973年，是台灣第一家專業舞蹈公司。四十二年後，它已成為這個島嶼的流動，有界的象徵。星期三，它將在布魯克林音樂學院舉辦一年一度的下一波音樂節，並將在美國首映2013年作品“賴斯”。這次訪問將在周六舉行，將是該學院的第六次，也是第一次參加巡迴演出，包括洛杉磯（1月）和華盛頓（2月）的演出。該公司在春季前往巴黎。 </p><p>提升台灣在海外的形像是雲門的創始人，藝術總監兼首席編舞，68歲的林懷民的責任。 </p><p> “他是一個非常公開的人物，”台北國立藝術大學舞蹈研究教授Yatin Lin（無關係）說。 “由於中國大陸的政治局勢，我們的政治領導人很難在海外活動，所以很多人認為他不僅僅是一位藝術家，而且還是一種台灣文化大使。” </p><p>本月，當這位舞蹈指導進入公司新建築的排練劇場時，展示了這一承諾，穿著他的標誌性制服（黑色T卹，黑色褲子），揮舞著黑色背包和一包香煙。當他在一張面向舞台的桌子上安頓下來時，該公司的22名舞者準備在一個月內完成他們的第一次完整的“賴斯”演出。 </p><p>隨著音樂 - 客家民歌，鼓聲和西方古典音樂的彙編 - 開始，一個孤獨的舞者大步走出一個長而顫抖的藤條。在接下來的70分鐘裡，舞者們在雲門的混合美學展示中鐫刻，跳躍，折疊和展開他們的身體，結合了西方古典舞蹈技巧和東方“圓潤”運動，吸取武術和太極拳。在播出期間遺失的是製作的背景，在台灣東南部池上的一個水稻種植週期拍攝的一個豐富的視頻。 </p><p>林先生大部分都是沉默的，塗鴉的筆記，只是間歇地大喊（“不要急，不要急！”和“呼吸！”）。在舞者們拿出他們最後的，精心編排的弓箭之後，他站起來並經歷了他的筆記，與個人一起進行了微小的調整。排練進展順利，現在舞者們需要專注於為即將到來的賽季照顧他們的身體，他們後來告訴他們，他們坐在舞台上，用泡沫輥拉伸和按摩他們的肌肉。 </p><p>後來，在公司的辦公室裡，林先生談到了他對舞者和社會的義務。 </p><p> “我經常提醒舞者，當他們在舞台上時，他們往往是很多人看到的唯一被認為是台灣人的台灣人，”他說。 </p><p>自1947年林先生出生於台灣以來，情況發生了很大的變化。蔣介石和國民黨的國民革命軍在1949年中國共產黨失去內戰後逃到了這裡。幾十年來，國民黨以專制的手段統治台灣，直到1996年台灣選民第一次當選總統。從那以後台灣一直被認為是一個民主國家（並且可能在1月份選出第一位女性總統），但該島仍然是一個有爭議的領土。 </p><p>作為五個孩子中最年長的孩子，林先生培養了多種激情，包括政治，寫作和舞蹈。僅僅幾年之後，在愛荷華大學作家工作室的一名學生，他決定追求編舞。他在紐約度過了兩個夏天，在瑪莎格雷厄姆學校學習舞蹈，在愛荷華州完成學位後，他回到台灣，很快就開始了雲門。 </p><p>公司誕生僅僅兩年之後，林先生和許多其他台灣人一樣，認為這是國家近期政治史上的一個決定性時刻：1971年的決議取代台北政府作為中國在聯合國的代表贊成北京政府</p><p> “當我開辦公司時，我說，&#39;由中國人編排，由中國人編排，中國人為中國觀眾跳舞&#39;，”林先生說，他的家人已經在台灣生活了好幾代。 “然後台灣被趕出了聯合國，我突然想知道我是誰。” </p><p>該活動啟發了“遺產”（1978），描繪了台灣的早期歷史。隨後是“流浪者之歌”，“月亮之水”和“草書”三部曲等作品。 </p><p> Cloud Gate在美國的表現評論參差不齊。評論家們讚揚了公司的東西方式，安娜·基塞爾戈夫在2003年的“紐約時報”上寫道，“月亮水”是一部“與眾不同的作品”。但是，“泰晤士報”的阿拉斯泰爾麥考利在2011年寫道，作品是“重複”，並稱為“牆上的水漬”“缺乏輕盈和幽默。” </p><p>隨著公司的地位越來越高，台灣的現代舞蹈場景也越來越多。 </p><p> “在雲之門之前，甚至沒有像武茲這樣的東西，”台灣舞蹈論壇的創始人兼藝術總監，57歲的平衡用舞者這個詞來說。 “以前，人們認為跳舞是你在學校可以做的事情，但這不是一個值得做的事情。他們只是稱舞者&#39;towowu de ren&#39;，“字面意思是跳舞的人。 </p><p> 65歲的Lin Lee-Chen是台北林瑞傳奇舞蹈劇院的創始人兼藝術總監，他說，“今天台灣的舞蹈場景非常多樣化”，舞蹈公司“各種規模和風格”。 </p><p>當被問及他可能退休時，雲門的林先生不願發表評論。但他承認，該公司的新綜合體，他說將允許他的劇團和其他舞蹈和戲劇企業使“雲門能量”永久化，這將使他更容易離開。 </p><p>他說，“我不想要任何雕像。” “我是佛教徒。我認為一切都只是虛幻的，特別是對舞者而言。 </p><p> “我們知道舞蹈會發生，但它會在它發生時消失，”他說。 “我們所創造的只是空氣。我們給社會一個不同的空氣，就是這樣。“

</p><p>答案很簡單。馬先生知道，他的黨，國民黨或國民黨很可能不僅在1月16日失去總統職位，而且在歷史上首先失去對議會的控制權，把權力交給政治家更好地調整選民的反統一情緒。馬英九和他在中國的同行都迫不及待地做出最後一刻的交易，這將使國民黨有機會繼續控制台灣的立法機關。 </p><p>人們普遍猜測，馬先生和習近平之間可能會出現的唯一情況是，習近平向台灣即將卸任的總統做出讓步，希望能夠繼續下去。國民黨控制台灣。 </p><p>如果馬先生和習先生特別聰明 - 而且近期的歷史不能保證 - 他們可能已經同意習近平將做出一個宏偉的姿態，例如撤回目前威脅台灣的導彈的提議，作為回報繼續保持現狀，走向更緊密的關係。邏輯是這樣一個宏偉的姿態會引起緊張的台灣選民的共鳴，甚至可能重塑選舉前景。 </p><p>或者，習近平可能會向台灣提供更緊密的經濟聯繫，並在中國的亞洲基礎設施投資銀行中扮演一個角色，迄今為止，該銀行一直被台灣拒絕。但這種情況會失敗，只能將台灣選民進一步推進反對派民主進步黨的陣營，民進黨在民意調查中佔據主導地位。 </p><p>台灣越來越多地將與中國的經濟聯繫視為對其政治和文化自治的威脅。事實上，馬雲先生試圖與中國進行經濟和解，這在很大程度上不僅導致了對國民黨的不滿，也對台灣的整個政治進程產生了不滿。這是獨立黨派，學生抗議和身份政治增加的重要因素。 </p><p>但讓我們想像一下，兩位領導人能夠做出最明智的行動，習近平向台灣提供了一項讓步 - 例如在狹窄的台灣海峽上拆除導彈 - 這使得國民黨在一些難以捉摸的議會席位中獲勝。 </p><p>對習先生和馬先生來說，這將是一場胜利 - 特別是如果國民黨能夠繼續留在議會。總統二人組可以將其作為實現和平與和解的重大進展，將其打包給國際社會。西方專欄作家會高興地搓手，並用中國和台灣在一個充滿衝突的世界推動和平的條件寫下來。 </p><p>儘管如此，事實仍然是，週六在新加坡發生的事情只不過是憤世嫉俗的政治 - 對台灣來說代價巨大的玩世不恭政治。原因是：自1949年中國共產黨執政以來，其領導人之一將首次成為台灣選舉過程中的經紀人。 </p><p>這不是中國領導層所獲得的。這是中國人欺負的一個立場。與此同時，馬先生通過加入對其主權構成最大威脅的力量背叛了他的選民 - 純粹是出於政治利益。

</p><p>這使得死亡在像台灣這樣的島國大做生意，這個島國略大於馬里蘭州。 True Dragon Tower由台灣上市公司Lung Yen Life Service擁有，該公司是按市值計算的全球第三大殯儀服務運營商。經過十年的建設，該塔於2002年終於開業。它的高度飆升部分是對台灣火葬率迅速提高的回應。龍雁發言人表示，在二十世紀五十年代（pdf，中文鏈接），台灣政府推動它而不是地面埋葬，預計未來會出現空間緊張。台灣90％以上的人現在火化，這一比例與亞洲其他發達地區如日本和香港相似。 </p><p>根據世界衛生組織對老齡化社會的定義，65歲以上人口目前佔台灣2360萬人口的14％以上。根據政府的預測，台灣的人口將在2021年達到峰值，並在2050年降至2000萬以下。該國已經是世界上出生率最低的國家之一，隨著台灣的生育率繼續下降，到2065年，41.2％的人口人口可能是老年人。然而，老年人口眾多的挑戰已經開始;在過去的兩年裡，台灣的死亡人數平均每年超過17萬人，並且每年都在增加。台灣大部分地區多山，不適合發展，因此近700萬人集中在台北本土和首都周邊的新北市。 </p><p>隨著生活與死亡之間的競爭在台北這樣人口稠密的城市中愈演愈烈，公司和政府正在推廣公眾在很大程度上接受的其他形式的埋葬，儘管有時根深蒂固的死亡信念意味著公眾並不總是很快採用它們。 </p><h2>閃爍的佛像</h2><p>在True Dragon Tower，來世的空間並不便宜。畢竟，該建築被設計為“死者的酒店”，正如公司女發言人所描述的那樣。 </p><p>一個基本的個人利基措施大約22乘25厘米（9乘10英寸），起價約為200,000新台幣（6,500美元）。更精細的利基在高端可能花費超過100萬新台幣（不包括其他虛假程序的費用，如追悼會和焚燒產品）。作為參考，2018年台灣一名工人的平均月工資約為40,000新台幣。有時人們為自己購買壁龕，但更常見的是，死者的家人會籌集資金來支付正確的費用。利基的費用無限期地保留了空間，因此家庭不必擔心增加更多的租約。 </p><p>在外面，塔的形狀像一個白色的梯形棱柱，幾乎完全不透明，頂部有一座寶塔。塔樓的每個樓層都有不同的主題，具體取決於客戶的宗教信仰和審美偏好。一層提供嵌入每個壁龕門的最先進的LED迷你佛像（從日本進口的技術）等功能。其他人提供更多中性調色板，供基督徒或無神論者使用。其中最引人注目的是17樓，由普利茲克獎得主日本建築師安藤忠雄設計。它擁有一個沐浴在白色大理石地板上的空間，並與瓷器壁龕疊放，以喚起天堂般的來世的輕盈。大約8％的真龍塔的壁龕已經被佔用。 </p><p>根據中國人的信仰，精神依然存在於來世，所以人們希望他們的親人被安葬在一個愉快的地方。這就是為什麼塔周圍有一個公園 - 它是死者酒店體驗的一部分。這個由龍仁家族擁有的土地佔地面積約55公頃（136英畝），俯瞰台灣海峽。該公園的設計旨在實現建築物最為吉祥的基本風水原則（付費牆），當他們面向山脈後面的水。墳墓和陵墓點綴著這個空間，迎合了台灣最富有的個人和家庭。還有一個動物骨灰龕，反映了台灣人願意為寵物分配的大量資金，因為有更少的人有孩子可以花錢。 </p><p>龍雁的設施需求只會增長。在接下來的五到七年裡，安藤將在真龍塔旁邊建造另一個（更水平的）骨灰龕，並配有盛滿櫻花樹的花園。這位日本建築師還將在台灣周圍建造另外三個這樣的骨灰龕和公園空間。 </p><h2>生態墓葬</h2><p>對於一般台灣公民而言，龍顏的產品是遙不可及的，其中許多人將轉向公共服務，公民支付最低費用將被埋在公共設施中。由於骨灰龕變得人滿為患 - 而NIMBYism阻止政府自由建設新的設施，以便在人口稠密的城市地區儲存人們的骨灰 - 亞洲各國政府大力推廣其他形式的葬禮來解決土地稀缺問題。 </p><p>自2000年代以來，台灣政府和一些宗教機構一直在提供環保的“生態埋葬”。顧客可以選擇在海上散落一個親戚的骨灰，或者埋在花壇或周圍的土堆中一顆樹。台北太平間服務辦公室的官員王文秀表示，首都每年約有24,000人死亡，台北三大公共場所的空間不足。目前，除非有人續簽租約，否則所有的灰燼必須在50年後從他們的壁龕中挖掘出來。如果沒有人這樣做，那麼政府就會挖出灰燼並將生態掩埋起來。 </p><p>中國傳統的祖先崇拜和堅信死者應該有一個永恆的休息場所，這使得灰燼分散成為大多數台灣人接受的堅定主張。但它正在流行起來。在台北，大約22％的人在2018年上半年選擇了生態埋葬，特別是樹葬（海葬是台灣最不受歡迎的生態埋葬形式）。非傳統的葬禮在其他地方取得的成功較少，例如在香港，儘管政府試圖（付費牆）推廣這些葬禮，但只有13％的人在2017年選擇了生態葬禮。 </p><h2>走向主流</h2><p>生態埋葬在台灣取得如此成功的原因有幾個。首先，他們是自由的。王說，台北政府甚至會資助那些想把親戚的骨灰帶出公共骨灰龕進行綠色葬禮的人。 </p><p>另一個原因是人口統計學。台灣逢甲大學土地管理副教授王晨玲（與其他王無關）表示，隨著台灣人口老齡化和出生率驟降，沒有家屬的人更容易選擇無恥的埋葬形式，不需要親戚傾向於墳墓或進行祖先崇拜的儀式。王說，特別是在一位受人尊敬的佛教大師於2009年去世後，宗教團體對將這一概念納入主流也產生了重大影響。他選擇將骨灰散落在他建立於修道院的修道院的花園中。台北市郊。今天，甚至還有一個等待名單（中文鏈接），用於修道院的樹葬。 </p><p>但台灣人對待死亡的方式正在發生根本性的變化。城市太平間官員王先生表示，成功嘗試“停放”生態墓地也有助於使死亡變得不那麼可怕和禁忌，更多地成為日常生活的一部分，並在此過程中促進綠色葬禮。 </p><p>台北現在有兩個公園（中文鏈接），可以作為墓地進行樹木和花葬。人們越來越多地在那裡閒逛 - 政府甚至在樹木墓地舉辦音樂會 - 作為一種記憶死者的共同方式，而不是在墳墓或骨灰龕中進行傳統儀式。在未來，前往其中一個公園可能就像“去藝術博物館”，王說。 </p><p>地理學家Lily Kong在2011年的學術期刊（付費專欄）中寫道，台北是一個成功地改變了中國文化中的墓地觀念的城市，即“不健康的m氣”。 </p><p>由於土地緊張的國家的人們遠離那些佔據太多空間的文化習俗，他們可能會發現這些地方的生活更加愉快。他們的後代可以參加音樂會或在公園散步，以此來紀念他們的祖先，而不是尋找專門為死者服務的莊嚴空間。 </p><p>請務必下載適用於iOS的Quartz Brief應用程序，以探索我們在增強現實中的龍塔3D模型。

“每逢聖誕節，警察都會監視教堂。我從來沒有聽說過任何危險的事情，但他們這樣做是因為他們擔心，“他說。他沒有在今年聖誕節前夕或聖誕節那天慶祝，而是計劃在假期結束後舉行少於30人的聚會。 </p><h2>聖誕節沒有基督</h2><p>儘管中國對聖誕節持有政治謹慎態度，但其商業潛力是不可錯過的。世俗裝飾品在購物中心無處不在，現在這個節日被推廣為11月11日光棍節零售豐收和農曆新年之間的一個休閒購物期。據彭博社報導，中國製造業在假日期間還建立了一個價值56億美元的產業，生產童話燈和其他節日用品。僅義烏製造業中心的產量就佔世界聖誕裝飾品的60％。 </p><p>海外旅行也助長了中國的聖誕狂熱。 2016年，芬蘭組織與阿里巴巴合作，開展了一項促進芬蘭旅遊業的活動，其中羅瓦涅米的聖誕老人村是其主要景點之一。該市還被指定為黑龍江省冬季首府哈爾濱的“友好小鎮”。 2010年，當時的中國副總裁習近平去了羅瓦涅米，並在正式訪問期間與聖誕老人合影留念。 </p><p>來自羅瓦涅米的旅遊統計數據顯示，過去十年來中國遊客的過夜住宿數量迅速增加，從2010年的3,300人次增加到去年的32,349人次。 Visit Rovaniemi的常務董事SannaKärkkäinen表示，該市在中國社交網絡微博上為聖誕老人設立了一個賬戶（中文鏈接），並在2016年採用了支付寶支付系統，以滿足中國遊客的需求。 </p><p>在鎮上的主要郵局，來自中國各種形狀和大小的信件被堆放在角落裡的一個櫃子裡。有些潦草地寫在彩色文具上，並用經典聖誕節圖標的圖紙。其他的都是用傳統的中國書法在宣紙上精心編寫的。很多都是雙語的。 </p><p>大多數中國孩子可能並不完全了解聖誕節的宗教背景，也不了解中國與假期的複雜關係。儘管如此，聖誕節的普遍價值 - 慷慨，希望和感激 - 正是驅使他們寫信給聖尼克的原因。 </p><p>在北京長大，張先生首先從小學教師那裡了解到聖誕老人，他們強調自己只不過是一個西方文化的虛構人物。儘管如此，她對聖誕老人的概念著迷，並開始欣賞他所代表的精神 - 以至於當她在2011年年滿19歲時，她決定給他寫一封信。 </p><p> “在中國，我們沒有聖誕節，家庭比禮物更重要，”她用英文和中文寫道。 “但是你知道，一件小禮物對孩子來說意義重大，帶來如此多的快樂。雖然你真的不存在，善良確實存在。在我心裡，你代表著善意。“ </p>',NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250298242','[\"96\", \"156\",

</p><p>保守派團體提出的反對同性戀婚姻的三項動議，包括一項試圖限制男女之間婚姻的動議，都被接受了。支持L-LGBT群體提交的全民公決，包括提議改寫民法典以實現真正婚姻平等的公民投票，都失敗了。同性婚姻的支持者認為，除非法律改變，否則同性戀伴侶將不會享有與異性伴侶相同的福利和法律保護。 </p><p>台灣最高法院於2017年5月裁定，限制男女婚姻是違憲的，婚姻平等必須在兩年內合法化，或者通過改變民法或實施單獨的法律。如果不採取立法行動，同性戀夫婦將被允許根據現行法律自動登記結婚。許多人感到有希望台灣成為亞洲第一個使同性婚姻合法化的行列將不受阻礙地進行，總統蔡英文本人表示支持婚姻平等。 </p><p>然而，隨著時間的推移，執政的民進黨（DPP）顯然不會主動採取任何立法行動，因為它試圖在重要的地方選舉前保持民眾的支持。 ，這發生在上週末。這使得保守派團體能夠在台灣煽動反LGBT情緒 - 例如通過在社交媒體上傳播錯誤信息 - 並舉行全民公決以破壞婚姻平等。民進黨在地方選舉中也遭受重創。

Huang表示，這是“台灣人權的一次沉重打擊和倒退”。 </p><p>這是一個退步，因為在2017年，台灣高等法院裁定限制婚姻與異性戀夫妻是違憲的。但更廣泛地說，結果是公民投票如何深刻不民主的最新例子。 </p><p>高等法院的判決沒有使同性婚姻合法化;它只宣布立法機關必須在兩年內製定婚姻平等法。這意味著由台灣執政的民主進步黨（DPP）在2016年獲得權力後，將由此完成。它未能這樣做。 </p><p>在保守派基督徒的帶領下，這種無能為台灣反對婚姻平等的群體提供了機會。這些團體利用了2017年通過的新規則，這使得舉辦和通過公民投票變得更加容易。以前在台灣，公民投票要求5％的選民簽名，以便進行投票。那減少到1.5％。而且，對於通過的選票，現在只需要25％的人口的“是”投票，而之前的50％。 </p><p>這是一個低杠。儘管基督徒只佔台灣人口的5％，但他們能夠收集到進行全民公投所需的微不足道的280,000個簽名。他們將婚姻定義為“男女之間”的建議獲得了超過700萬的“是”投票 - 超過了支持同性婚姻的反公民投票，但遠不及台灣超過1800萬登記選民的一半。 </p><p>這種公民投票的自由主義方式適用於民進黨 - 一個廣泛支持LGBT權利的左傾政黨 - 這最初是為了放寬規則。當新的規則宣佈時，現任總統蔡英文稱這是“人民是主人”的“歷史性時刻”。 </p><p>但正如民進黨已經發現的那樣，這遠不是公民投票的現實。 </p><p>公民投票的一個問題是他們將高度複雜的問題簡化為簡單的是或否。當然，我們這個時代最重要的例子是英國退歐。由於歐盟是一個龐大的超國家實體，許多英國選民認為他們失去了發揮政治意願的能力。但是，將國家與其最重要的盟友的整個關係提煉為二元選擇是短視的，並且導致了確定英國脫歐究竟是什麼的噩夢，令人悲傷和憤怒的是每個人。 </p><p>台灣關於婚姻法的決定揭示了公民投票的更大問題：他們將政治變成人氣競賽。民主不僅僅是投票，還包括多元化和保護少數群體權利。在決定將婚姻歧視視為違憲時，法院正在採取行動保護LGBT社區的這些權利。另外，根據台灣的法律，公民投票只需要25％的選民說“是”，它甚至不符合多數人統治標準。 </p><p> 2017年，高等法院將台灣置於世界舞台，成為其他亞洲國家在人權問題上的榜樣。這個聲譽現在看起來很脆弱。週末，在民進黨在全國范圍內遭受更大的損失之後，蔡在政黨領導下卸任。因為沒有將同性婚姻納入法律，責備Tsai和民進黨有很多責任，責怪那些不能容忍除了自己以外的生活方式的保守派。但也指責一個政治機構將“人民的意志”置於人的權利之前。

</p><p>換句話說，中國軍隊入侵不再是台灣人最害怕的情景。中國接管台灣的戰略現在集中在混合戰爭戰術上，專制政權越來越多地部署在自由社會中。親北京的利益已經收購了大部分台灣媒體，並與北京協調傳播宣傳和假新聞以及操縱社交媒體。 </p><p>中國政府利用經濟脅迫來招募和懲罰台灣領導人。與此同時，中國正在加班加點剝離台灣的外交盟友，並將其排除在多邊機構之外。北京真的試圖從地圖上抹去這個國家。 </p><p>台灣是這些方法的試驗場，但中國現在將它們出口到其他地方，包括美國。外交部副部長許士謙表示，這不僅是對台灣的威脅，也是對全球民主國家的威脅。 </p><p> “台灣只是開始，”他說。 “他們希望他們的新文明成為一個新的全球秩序。這就是他們的想法。再加上他們的體力擴張，現在他們將夢想變為現實。“ </p><p>一些國民黨官員和前官員告訴我們的代表團擔心中國被誇大了，尋求與北京住宿是唯一合理的做法。前外交部副部長佈魯斯·林胡說，國民黨不是“親中國”，而是“親和平”。 </p><p> “台灣必須聰明地發揮它，”他說。 “為什麼我們要挑釁中國？” </p><p>國民黨官員堅稱他們支持美中關係，並沒有試圖安撫北京。但行動勝於雄辯。當Tsai與美國人交談時，高雄市長韓國宇，一位正在崛起的國民黨領導人和總統候選人，正在與中國共產黨官員在香港和澳門舉行有爭議的會議。很明顯，國民黨優先考慮哪種關係。 </p><p>美國有興趣幫助現任台灣政府捍衛其民主免受中國的干涉和侵略 - 但我們的意願受到質疑。特朗普政府雖然充滿了親台官員，卻一直不穩定。在軍售方面取得了進展，但在Tsai最想要的是美台自由貿易協定方面沒有取得進展。美國沒有足夠的支持台灣打擊中國的混合戰爭方式。 </p><p>實際上，與北京的住宿可能無法奏效，而中國在台灣的胃口只會隨著飲食而增長。台灣證明民主和中國文化可以共同發展，繁榮不需要壓制。這是北京出於顯而易見的原因無法容忍的一個例子。台灣的存在對中國共產黨的嚴重不安全感負有影響。 </p><p>但是時間快到了，美國很快就向台灣人民表明，他們拒絕默許北京在政治，經濟和社會方面的統治地位，並得到國際支持。

</p><p>情況</p><p>蔡英文總統在2016年以壓倒性優勢當選，承諾與中國保持和平關係，即使她抵制來自大陸的壓力，支持“一個中國原則” - 即使他們有不同，雙方都屬於同一個中國的理解關於這意味著什麼的想法。北京政府認為自己是台灣的合法統治者，儘管該島自1949年以來一直獨立統治。1月，中國國家主席習近平建議支持“一個中國”框架的中國大陸和台灣的團體和個人進入“深入的民主協商“並努力實現統一 - 這是他希望在他任職期間解決70年爭端的最明顯跡象。在Tsai警告中國繼續威脅之後一天，他發表了上述言論。台灣統治下的台灣 - 其黨支持實現完全獨立 - 與美國建立了更密切的聯繫，包括恢復美國對台灣的高級官方訪問，唐納德特朗普總統簽署了該法案。今年3月，特朗普政府表示可能向台灣出售戰鬥機，這一舉動將惹惱中國。習近平警告稱，擴大與台灣分歧的努力將“受到歷史的懲罰”，並且他的國家有能力製止任何獨立的企圖。中國已經挑選台灣少數幾個盟友，在台灣領空周圍定期進行“圍剿巡邏”，迫使國際航空公司將台灣列為中國的一部分。蔡的黨在11月的中國反對派地方選舉中遭受重創，引發了對她在2020年1月大選中前景的質疑。 </p><p>的背景</p><p>共產黨在1949年中國內戰中的勝利迫使民族主義國民黨政府逃離大陸，跨越110英里的台灣海峽以及150多萬難民。 20世紀70年代，當美國總統理查德尼克松將美國對台灣的外交承認轉移到台灣以遏制蘇聯時，堅定的美國支持得到了鞏固。即便如此，美國還是通過了1979年的法律，致力於維護台灣海峽的和平，並促進對台灣民主的軍售。經過38年經常殘酷的統治，台灣於1987年放棄戒嚴，一年後獲得了第一位土生土長的總統，後來成為1996年第一位民主選舉產生的領導人。緊張局勢爆發於中國兩次軍事行動 - 在20世紀50年代然後在20世紀90年代中期的台灣選舉中再次出現。 2005年，中國通過了一項法律，授權該島宣布獨立。即使只有少數幾個國家承認台灣，其2360萬人已將其經濟建設成為一個技術和製造業強國。平均收入是中國的三倍。蘋果的大部分iPhone都是由台灣公司製造的，而包括台灣半導體製造公司在內的科技巨頭在為其他公司製造計算機芯片方面處於世界領先地位。 </p><p>爭論</p><p>中國的目標是台灣1200多枚導彈，自政府分裂以來的七十年裡，沒有簽署任何和平條約。雖然許多中國觀察人士表示，軍事對抗存在太大的危險，特別是考慮到美國的參與和可能的經濟影響，特朗普的選舉給舊的假設增加了一定程度的不確定性。中國在亞洲爭議水域的行動表明了更具擴張性和侵略性的區域立場。台灣選民對中國缺乏政治自由持謹慎態度，轉向蔡在保持和平的同時建立國際關係 -

此舉將激怒北京。強硬的中國分析人士發表了一份報告，主張北京從委內瑞拉的美國政策中獲取一頁，並承認任何支持統一的候選人是台灣的下任總統。在台灣，一群不妥協的獨立活動家正在遊說他們的政府明年“創建一個獨立的國家並朝著正常的國家邁進”。北京警告說，台灣任何正式的獨立宣言都會導致戰爭。 </p><p>這些演習是在特朗普政府與北京之間關係惡化的背景下發生的，而中國國家主席習近平似乎對台灣運動感到擔憂。 </p><p>北京一直聲稱台灣是中國的一部分，並且從未放棄使用武力“團結祖國”的威脅。就其本身而言，美國的一個中國政策承認北京的立場，即只有一個中國，但華盛頓從來沒有對台灣是否屬於中華人民共和國採取立場。更重要的是，根據1979年簽署的“與台灣關係法”，美國在法律上有義務提供台灣的辯護。 </p><p>幾十年來，中國官員私下認為，隨著時間的推移和中國的經濟增長，台灣別無選擇，只能接受中國的擁抱。現在中國的分析師更加悲觀。首先，有些人認為中國的政治體制會演變成一個更自由的政治體系，這使得與中國的聯盟成為台灣許多人的明顯選擇。但相反，自1989年鎮壓天安門廣場周圍的民主抗議活動以來，今天的中國比任何時候都更加鎮壓。 </p><p>其次，許多台灣人因中國對香港的處理而被關閉，他們認為，如果中國控制下來，他們認為這是台灣未來事件的先兆。中國在1997年吸收了前英國殖民地，承諾 - 在“一國兩制”的口號下 - 讓它保持50年的獨特經濟體制，並承諾允許更多的民主。中國統治二十二年，北京沒有顯著擴大香港的民主，並開始公開干涉香港的內政。 </p><p>最後，經過近30年的台灣民主化，許多台灣人發現了一種獨特的身份，並沒有興趣與北京統一。 1992年民主剛剛在台灣開始時，台灣國立政治大學舉行的年度民意調查中，只有20％的受訪者稱自己為“只有台灣人”。2018年，超過50％的人這樣做。而那些僅僅認定為中國人的人，從1992年的四分之一下降到去年的不到3％。 </p><p>面對這些趨勢，習近平顯然認為劍拔弩張比柔軟觸感好。 1月2日，他在2012年接任共產黨領導人後首次就台灣問題發表重要講話時警告說，台灣“問題”不能推遲到另一代，並威脅台灣受到攻擊。他還要求台灣與中國之間的任何會談必須在雙方承認最終目標是統一的情況下進行。習近平的講話引發了台灣罕見的政治統一表現。代表獨立民主進步黨的蔡總統和主要的反對黨國民黨都拒絕了習近平的要求。 </p><p>習更強硬的陣容得到了中國強硬派的支持。在一位不願透露姓名的著名強硬派給我的報告中，有一組人士有點不可思議地表示，如果中國決定攻擊台灣，它可以說服俄羅斯，朝鮮和伊朗加入戰鬥。該報告還提倡對台灣實施經濟禁運，首先制定一份台灣獨立支持者名單，阻止他們在中國開展業務。 </p><p>英國“金融時報”最近報導稱，中國台灣事務委員會的官員一直在呼籲駐有大陸的台灣企業高管和台灣學生就台灣的命運進行討論。參加這些會議的台灣人將其描述為衡量台灣居民在中國的政治可靠性的一種方式。強硬派的報告呼籲中國政府找到一個願意接受中國統治的台灣領導人，就像美國與委內瑞拉反對派領導人胡安·瓜伊多一樣。 </p><p>這種類型的極端主義在台灣有迴響，獨立活動家對台灣的溫和立場感到不滿。在民主進步黨於11月地方選舉中失敗之後，由獨立福爾摩沙電視台主席郭培雄領導的獨立倡導者成立了一個名為福爾摩沙聯盟的組織，以推動獨立並組織有關該主題的公投。 </p><p>回到華盛頓，自1979年“台灣關係法案”通過以來，對台灣的支持率最高。現任布魯金斯學會的前外交官理查德·布什預言，邀請台灣總統出任國會會激怒北京。其他人則不那麼驚慌。 </p><p>無論如何，台灣作為美國和中國之間的問題多年來一直處於休眠狀態。 </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rSl5Z_4dZHeDCEjo9WkWo4klHXQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWKMMKBIW4I6TEDOTVK3MRI6WQ.jpg','[\"153\", \"201\", \"81\"]',0),(207,9,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/recent-developments-surrounding-the-south-china-sea/2019/04/01/3a9cc018-544d-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html','圍繞南海的近期發展','null','台灣表示，其飛機警告中國軍用飛機越過台灣海峽的中心線，稱中國的舉動是一種挑釁行為，試圖改變將該島與中國大陸分開的水道的現狀。','Christopher Bodeen | AP','1554102629000',1554102629000,'<p>北京 -

櫻花兄弟。 </p><p>但這本書的主要和更快樂的推動力是對英國植物人科林伍德（Collingwood Ingram）的認可，他從肯特郡的花園成為日本櫻花的著名守護者。他向西方介紹了約50個品種，並培育了Okame櫻花樹，因其正直的習性和早期開花而受到青睞。也許他最偉大的壯舉是保留大白櫻桃並將其送回日本，在那裡它被稱為Taihaku然後失去了種植。它以其大而單一的白色花朵而聞名。 </p><p>他最初將接穗送到日本的努力失敗了 - 他們已經乾涸而死了。但是他又寄了一批土豆，他們倖免於難。在那裡，你有一個英國人使用南美塊莖來恢復古老的亞洲櫻桃到它的家鄉。這必須是關於櫻桃樹將人們聚集在一起的力量的信息。本週，在波托馬克河畔，同樣的櫻花舞正在快樂地進行。 </p><p> Twitter上的@adrian_higgins </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RXBJ4Q0xr2Rf7lCVzhlMAIg_5K0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D76RVTR7REI6TE3BGAP7WW6V4Y.jpg','[\"261\", \"260\", \"208\"]',0),(211,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/26/when-it-comes-negotiating-with-china-devil-is-details/','談到與中國談判時，魔鬼就是細節','null','“這種不置可否的語言至關重要，因為華盛頓希望奉行自己的一個中國政策，即美國承認但不接受北京對台灣主權的主張或任何台灣人聲稱建國。','Neil Thomas','1553625124000',1553625124000,'<p>特朗普總統可能很快就會達成協議。 </p><p>經過多年批評中國以“不公平的貿易行為”“扯掉我們”，經過長達數月的雙邊關稅超過3600億美元的貿易戰，特朗普對與中國國家主席習近平宣布經濟協議持樂觀態度。在4月底可能會發生的峰會上。 </p><p>好消息是特朗普的談判代表似乎已經從中國獲得讓步，取消了外國公司與當地實體建立合資企業和禁止強制技術轉讓的要求。他們也正在採取執法機制，最終可能採取措施遏制中國猖獗的知識產權盜竊和保護主義，每年造成美國公司損失500億美元。 </p><p>但仍有很多工作要做，尤其是北京方面將協議草案翻譯成中文，因為雙方迄今只用英語進行操作。許多觀察家擔心，中國可以通過在最終文本中插入模糊語言來減少其承諾。由於在20世紀70年代後期關於美中正常化的談判表明，特朗普政府必須警惕警惕中國文本的忠誠，以免它成為破壞交易的後門工具。 </p><p> 1978年12月，美國外交官急於使與中國的雙邊關係正常化，因此允許北京方面對中華人民共和國建交聯合公報的重要變化進行了重大修改。這個正常化的公報被譽為“歷史性的發展”，標誌著三十年的孤立和美國對台灣的正式認可，這是一個北京認為是叛徒的自治島嶼。歷史學家恩里科·法爾德拉稱這種正常化的總統吉米·卡特“取得了最大的成功。”事實上，美國對中國的開放是美國冷戰對蘇聯的關鍵時刻。 </p><p>然而，1979年1月3日，國家安全委員會中國問題專家米歇爾·奧克森伯格向卡特國家安全顧問茲比格涅夫·布熱津斯基發送了一份非凡的備忘錄，以警告正常化公報中的“翻譯問題”。 </p><p>這個問題歸結為一個詞：“承認。”在1972年的上海公報中，美中關係的基礎文件，美國說它“承認台灣海峽兩邊的所有中國人都認為只有一個中國和台灣是中國的一部分。“ </p><p>這種不置可否的語言至關重要，因為華盛頓希望奉行自己的一個中國政策，即美國承認但不接受北京對台灣的主權主張或任何台灣人聲稱建國。同樣，正常化公報指出，美國政府“承認中國的立場，即只有一個中國，台灣是中國的一部分”。 </p><p>但是，雖然英文單詞“承認”在兩篇文章中都是相同的，但在翻譯中卻變成了不同的東西。上海公報使用詞語“renshi dao”（認識到），它意味著知識和理解，而規範化公報使用動詞“chengren”（承認），這是一個強有力的術語，意味著承認和同意。 </p><p>這怎麼發生的？ </p><p>在他的備忘錄中，奧克森伯格告知布熱津斯基，在正常化公報最終確定之前的“忙碌日子”中，國家安全委員會“從未見過”中文版本的文本，因為它“完全來自英語。”正常化公報前美國聯絡辦公室（USLO）在北京向Oksenberg表示，中文翻譯“沒有問題”。之後，USLO向Oksenberg解釋說它注意到了“chengren”的插入，但決定不通知華盛頓，因為中國官員使用“幾個英漢詞典”來證明新翻譯“沒有實質意義”。 </p><p> Oksenberg不同意。他擔心政府“篡改了上海公報的&#39;聖令”，並且“不止一些語言學家”會說“成人”“表示”更強烈地接受中國的立場“，而不是”renshi dao“。奧克森伯格暗示，如果他看到中文文本草案，華盛頓會推遲。 </p><p>這種變化的後果可能很重要。台灣政權的美國支持者，曾在華盛頓建立了一個強大的中國遊說團體，本可以抓住更加和解的中國措辭，將卡特政府官員描述為愚蠢行為，並加強對國會山正常化政策的抵制。 </p><p>為了避免這些雷區，奧克森伯格建議採取三管齊下的防禦措施：首先，兩國政府都“按照英文文本進行工作”;第二，美國的觀點是“用英語表達”;第三，“chengren”被其他國家用於中國。布熱津斯基強調了“用英語表達”這幾個字，並寫道：“是的。 ZB。“當時的副國務卿沃倫克里斯托弗後來在國會辯論中證實，美國會”將英文文本視為具有約束力的文本“。 </p><p>然而，北京認為中文文本同樣具有約束力。外交部官方歷史上的美中關係突顯了美國與“成人”的協議 - 北京對台灣的看法。 </p><p>衝突不僅僅是語言之一。似乎北京利用美國傾向於英國首次談判來推進自己的外交政策目標。從事規範化公報工作的政府翻譯石燕華幾年後回憶說，當曾幫助起草該文件的高級外交官張文金故意將“renshi dao”改為“chengren”時，她出席了，因為後者是“更符合“北京對台政策”。這些事實與向USLO提供的保證相矛盾，即新翻譯“沒有實質意義”。 </p><p>這一披露表明，USLO未能反對新的中文文本是一個大錯，可能是美中關係緊張，也不是美國的政策不支持。 </p><p>華盛頓幸運的是，由於美國將自己對該協議的理解轉變為該地區的政策，因此中國人專注於國內發展以及與蘇聯和越南的戰略競爭。 1979年4月，“與台灣關係法”為美國與台灣之間仍然存在的事實上的外交關係創造了法律基礎。 1982年向台灣提出的六項保證確認美國“不會正式承認中國對台灣的主權”。 </p><p>然而，這並不意味著中國的語言詭計毫無意義。在國內，它有助於鞏固北京對台灣主張的合法性，支持其共產黨控制台北的中國版本。 </p><p>而這個錯誤的歷史可能還沒有結束。隨著中國越來越多地在全球事務中“設定可接受的話語參數”，特別是在其對台灣主權的主張方面，正規化公報的話語仍然可能成為政治的有力武器，外交彈藥具有潛力（如果有爭議的話）如果北京決定強迫與台灣重新統一的話，主權問題應該得到解決。 </p><p>這個錯誤不是一次性的。在過去的40年裡，西方觀察家經常忽略了北京對其國家野心的看法。華盛頓與中國的接觸政策可能是最好的選擇，但如果歷屆政府更認真地對待北京的話，美國可能會更積極地保護國際秩序免受政治，經濟和安全方面的挑戰。一個專制的超級大國 - 今天需要達成新貿易協議的挑戰。 </p><p>由於美中關係處於二十年來最低潮，兩國政府在貿易，技術，地緣政治和人權等問題上日益分化，正規化公報是過度自信的一個教訓，導致許多美國人忽視了中國的意圖。 </p><p>特朗普政府在翻譯這項新協議時，絕不能讓中國再次採取快速措施。因為，對北京而言，現實並非“用英語表達”。 </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qcQ5lNwUrJcNYe2avGWm-MarXPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLHCXBC6IMI6RNSWENWGEFHPAE.jpg','[\"115\", \"177\", \"75\"]',0),(212,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/23/taiwans-bikini-hiker-dies-after-falling-into-ravine-solo-trek/','台灣的“比基尼徒步旅行者”在單人跋涉後跌入山溝後死亡','null','吳獨自喜歡徒步旅行 -

並且是對台灣和美國的強制性信號。這是你需要知道的： </p><h3>美國同意向台灣出售戰鬥機。 </h3><p> 3月，美國同意向台灣出售F-16V戰鬥機 - 第四代機型。美國最後一次向台灣出售F-16戰鬥機是在1992年9月。 </p><p> [中美台關係波動不定。這是正在發生的事情。] </p><p>北京認為向台灣出售噴氣式戰鬥機和潛艇等武器平台是一條隱含的紅線。過去，中國使用強製手段阻止各國向台灣出售這些武器平台。這表明，上週的PLAAF事件旨在向台灣和美國發出關於戰鬥機銷售的威懾信號。 </p><p>中國外交部和國防部就此次抗議向美國提出抗議，重申中國將“採取一切必要措施”堅決捍衛其主權。特朗普政府於4月5日決定暫停F-16V協議，直到美國與中國達成貿易協議，這表明中國可能將雙邊貿易談判作為討價還價的籌碼。 </p><h3>美國船隻在台灣海峽。 </h3><p> 3月24日，美國海軍和海岸警衛隊船隻通過台灣海峽。中國外交部抗議，敦促美國謹慎行事。 </p><h3>台灣總統在夏威夷停了下來。 </h3><p>同一周，蔡英文在美國中途停留。中國抗議這違反了“一個中國”的政策，這一政策要求美國和其他國家不要與台灣建立官方外交關係。 </p><p>這些行動在中國的分類賬中似乎是相對較小的挑釁。但對北京而言，未採取強制行動以表明其決心可能會在未來產生更多來自台灣和美國的挑釁行為。 </p><h3>中國如何使用其強製手段？ </h3><p>過去，中國利用軍事和非軍事工具迫使台灣和其他國家停止和阻止中國認為具有威脅性的行動。我的書項目表明，中國有選擇地使用這些工具。由於中國相對於美國的經濟脆弱性，北京往往較少針對美國。 </p><p> [一個更加自信的北京為美中關係提出新問題] </p><p>這是一個例子。當法國於1992年向台灣出售幻影2000戰鬥機時，中國採取嚴厲的外交和經濟制裁措施，包括禁止向中國出口法國小麥，在中國南方城市廣州向德國申請地鐵，凍結法國項目建設中國核電站關閉法國駐廣州領事館。 </p><p>在這種情況下，中國有“退出選擇權”。例如，法國，德國和英國都在競標廣州地鐵項目。中國駐法國大使在回憶錄中指出，中國轉向德國製裁法國。 </p><h3>對美國經濟報復的恐懼使中國重新回到了1992年。 </h3><p>在1992年美國向台灣出售F-16之後，對中美經濟關係的擔憂使得北京方面沒有做出類似回應。出售僅僅12天后，國會通過了一項法案，將最惠國（MFN）貿易地位與中國人權狀況聯繫起來。 </p><p>我工作文件的證據表明，1992年F-16期間中國政府分析人員焦急地等待著。美國總統布什總統否決有條件延長最惠國地位 - 國會是否會推翻否決權？在出售26天后，布什最終否決了這項法案。 </p><p>失去最惠國待遇將對中國的出口產生不利影響，前世界銀行負責中國的官員向我證實。中國和美國將在武器銷售三週後進行市場准入談判。如果雙方未達成協議，美國貿易代表將威脅對價值40億美元的中國商品徵收100％的關稅。 </p><p> [美國和中國正在玩一場危險的比賽。接下來是什麼？] </p><p>中國專家約翰·加弗寫道，鄧小平當時贊同中國外交部的一份內部報告，因為“中國需要優先考慮經濟利益”，避免北京失去最大的貿易戰。 </p><p>到1994年，克林頓總統已將最惠國待遇與中國的人權狀況脫鉤。 1995年，當台灣總統李登輝在康奈爾大學和台灣舉行選舉時，中國於1995年作出強制反應。北京進行了導彈試驗並召回了中國駐美國大使。 </p><p>這些措施，北京希望，將阻止美國和其他國家在未來給予李簽證，中國認為這是支持台灣在法律上獨立的道路。 </p><p>有鑑於此，蔡英文總統最近通過夏威夷過境以及與美國高級領導人的會晤可能是中國反應的一個因素。除非官方邀請台灣總統訪問美國，否則中國對這些過境的強制可能會集中在台灣。中國的目標很可能是阻止台灣領導人在未來通過美國過境或與美國高級官員會面。 </p><p>中國和台灣長期以來關係緊張。但隨著中國經濟影響力的增強，北京開始威脅對美國向台灣出售武器的經濟和外交制裁。從長遠來看，如果中國成功實現出口市場多元化並減少對美中貿易的依賴，北京可能會變得更具強制性 - 特別是對台灣而言。 </p><p> Ketian Vivian Zhang是斯坦福大學Shorenstein亞太研究中心的博士後研究員。她將於2019年夏天加入喬治梅森大學政策與政府學院，擔任國際安全助理教授。 </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nsYOEOJGaOsAAA5n3WhaAGaxLQ0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QL4VC4CO5QI6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg','[\"13\", \"278\", \"81\"]',0),(214,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/10/she-went-hospital-an-infection-doctors-found-four-bees-living-her-eye-eating-her-tears/','她去醫院感染了。醫生髮現她的眼睛裡有四隻蜜蜂在吃眼淚。','','洪某告訴英國廣播公司時，第二天在醫院，當洪發現汗水蜜蜂正在流淚時，醫生感到寬慰的是，當疼痛加劇時，那位穿著接觸者的女士並沒有過度揉眼睛。','Timothy Bella','1554921425000',1554921425000,'<p>這位29歲的女士不知道為什麼她的眼睛腫了。她無法忍受痛苦，無法停止撕毀。 CTS新聞報導，這位台灣女性表示，她對為什麼她認為感染問題不斷惡化感到困惑。 </p><p>但是，當她姓He的女性在台灣佛音大學醫院接受治療時，醫生沒有發現細菌感染。醫院的眼科主任洪志婷在通過顯微鏡觀察他的眼睛時，目睹了他以前從未見過的東西。 </p><p>昆蟲腿從她的一個眼窩擺動。 </p><p>他猛地掏出一隻名叫Halictidae的小蜜蜂，或者一隻“汗蜂”。它還活著。 </p><p>醫生沒有完成。很快他就抽出了第二隻汗蜂。還有第三個。 </p><p>最後，第四隻蜜蜂被從女人的眼瞼拉出來。 </p><p>醫生在上週的新聞發布會上說，渴望鹽，蜜蜂已經吃掉了他的眼淚，後來將奇怪的醫學診斷描述為“世界第一”。這些昆蟲在他的眼瞼下做了一個新家 -

這場戰鬥肯定會成為美國與中國目前緊張關係的一部分。 </p><p>第二次世界大戰後，中國內戰在蔣介石的民族主義勢力和毛澤東的共產主義游擊隊之間重新開始。蔣被擊敗並將他的中華民國政府移到台灣，而毛澤東於1949年在大陸宣布成立中華人民共和國。在冷戰的大部分時間裡，雙方仍然是敵人，沒有官方聯繫。自20世紀80年代以來，隨著台灣解除戒嚴，大陸開始開放，兩國關係逐步改善。 </p><p>多年來，台灣的中國人身份逐漸下降，台灣人的身份明顯增多。自台灣成為多黨民主國家以來，兩岸關係變得更加複雜。但是，當馬英九從2008年到2016年在台灣執政時，台中關係穩定友好，兩岸交流充滿活力。 </p><p>隨著民主進步黨蔡英文在2016年當選為中華民國總統，這種情況發生了變化，過去幾年來，北京與台灣之間的關係陷入僵局。從北京的角度來看，2019年是向台灣發出新信息和新警告的恰當時機。作為一個具有歷史使命感的人，習近平一直在認真地把台灣視為民族復興的“中國夢”的一部分。正如他在講話中自信地說，台灣必須並將與祖國聯合起來。 </p><p>習近平在講話中重申了北京對台灣的長期政策，以“國家統一”為目標，以“一國兩制”為榜樣。從這個意義上說，習近平的講話是以往官方聲明的延續，這些聲明的重點是北京的和平統一和兩岸交流的意圖，同時在必要時保留使用武力的權利。 </p><p>但習近平的講話也包含了一些新內容。首先，他為台灣提出的“一國兩制”模式提出了更大的靈活性。這一點很重要，因為中國在與香港和澳門的關係中以其他國家的“一國兩制”模式運作。習近平無疑已經意識到香港的嚴峻現實，北京如此迅速地破壞了該市的政治制度，民主活動和媒體自由，這令人沮喪。 </p><p>習近平不想與台灣複製這種情況，正在進行重大的政策調整。與1997年在沒有香港人投入的情況下實施“一國兩制”模式的香港案相比，習近平所暗示的是讓台灣人為台灣開發新模式。此舉為台灣注入統一模式的自我決定。 </p><p>習近平還提出台灣各黨派代表應加入北京進行政治磋商，討論兩岸關係，為台灣的未來作出政治安排。這可能是他演講中最有趣和最具創新性的部分，因為它基本上通過迴避不受歡迎的執政黨來啟動統一進程。他沒有製定統一的時間表，但這項建議一旦實施，將代表北京實現統一目標的巨大進步，並採取具體措施為未來做好準備。 </p><p>令人遺憾的是，蔡政府立即並且毫不猶豫地斷然拒絕了習的提議。如果蔡政府願意接受討論，或願意提出改善兩岸關係的計劃，台灣就可以利用其充滿活力的民主作為塑造中國大陸未來的工具。北京說任何事情都可以在“一個中國”下討論;台灣當然可以而且應該提高統一的先決條件。這將給大陸帶來巨大的壓力，使其走向民主化。 </p><p>去年，蔡在大陸的地位變硬了。現在她只用“中國”來代表大陸，而不是她在任職第一年時使用的更為和解的“中國大陸”。在台灣，當政治家將大陸稱為“中國”時，它清楚地表明了他們的反華和支持獨立的立場。 </p><p> Tsai轉向更強硬的方法有很多可能的原因：到目前為止，她在學期間失去了五個外交盟友。北京在國際舞台上感受到“欺凌”;她採取中國牌的策略，以扭轉內心對她表現不佳的不滿情緒;她的政黨去年在地方選舉中失利了。 </p><p>儘管習近平在統一過程中提供了更大的靈活性，但顯然北京對蔡的“觀望”態度已經結束。中國台灣事務辦公室首次公開抨擊蔡作為“分離主義者”。幾乎可以肯定的是，在她努力連任之前，Tsai將在2020年台灣選舉之前變得更加強硬。她的領導能力令大多數台灣人失望，包括她的支持者。對中國採取強硬態度並將自己打造成捍衛台灣主權的領導者可能有助於她贏得一些選票。 </p><p>習近平的堅定決心和蔡的強烈抵抗表明台灣海峽在未來幾年內不會平靜。這對美國有實際意義。蔡將努力加強與美國的關係，同時保持反華立場。並且有理由相信華盛頓會接受她的提議。特朗普總統於2018年簽署了幾項支持台灣的法案，其中包括“台灣旅行法”和“亞洲再保險倡議法”，這是北京不滿的舉措。 </p><p>在與中國打交道時，美國政府可能繼續打台灣牌，但台灣人民必須保持謹慎和清醒。特朗普有一天可能決定賣掉台灣以與中國達成協議，這難以想像。台灣的未來與中國有著千絲萬縷的聯繫。台灣可能希望與北京合作，為島嶼民主尋求雙方都能接受的結果，而不是遠離中國。 </p><p>這篇文章已經更新。 </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IT_a6-bPDQqr044P1Mo0zlAYsi0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LKA3U7ANOII6TDYMN6DYUJRIRI.jpg','[\"252\", \"77\", \"135\"]',0),(216,9,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/09/two-views-tom-dundon-carolina-hurricanes-savior-aaf-scourge/','Tom Dundon的兩個觀點：Carolina Hurricanes的救世主和AAF禍害','一位相對不為人知的德州商人正在以大膽的舉動製作頭條新聞，這些舉動產生了不同的結','在他作為職業體育隊老闆的第一個完整賽季中，Dundon的卡羅來納州颶風隊重新回到了NHL季后賽，擊敗了聯盟最長的干戰，並成為聯盟最小市場之一的冰上派對的焦點。','Rick Maese','1554864967000',1554864967000,'<p> Tom Dundon能夠在沒有名望的情況下建立自己的財富，遠遠不是聚光燈下的成功，似乎有了所有的答案，即使沒有真正的公開質疑。 </p><p> “我從未接受任何採訪，也從未想過任何關注，”Dundon說。 </p><p>現在沒有避免它。突然間，有很多東西要談 -

但事實並非如此。你有錢。” </p><p> Dundon現在知道人們正在談論他和他大聲進入體育界。這不是他的目標，但至少他們正在談論，他認為，特別是關於颶風的未來。 </p><p> “當我收購球隊時，我意識到卡羅萊納颶風不是世界上的話題，而且必須是，”Dundon說。 “從長遠來看，它需要關注我們的球員和我們的教練。但短期來說，我覺得我必須要幫忙。我想你會隨著時間的推移發現我會進入陰影中。團隊的故事越多越好。“ </p><p> Tramel Raggs對本報告做出了貢獻。 </p>',NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c1_vUGKQtmJyPIlibd9pkUL7CUw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W5ESUYBULII6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg','[\"208\", \"210\", \"79\"]',0),(217,9,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-might-china-want-to-steal-these-silicon-secrets/2019/04/11/55ebbdf4-5c56-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html','為什麼中國想要竊取這些矽秘密？','ASML的技術對於製造下一代芯片至關重要。中國可能想要竊取其藍圖並不奇怪。','法院判決XTAL去年向ASML支付了2.3億美元的賠償金，但其與中國政府的聯繫在當時並不明確。','Alex Webb | Bloomberg','1555023688000',1555023688000,'<p>如果您正在為下一次技術革命編制一個具有關鍵構建模塊的公司候選名單，那肯定會包括ASML Holding NV。 </p><p>據Het Financieele Dagblad週四發布的一份報告稱，這就是為什麼這家荷蘭半導體製造設備製造商成為被指控與中國政府關係的競爭對手盜竊的目標尤其重要。 </p><p>荷蘭報紙稱，加利福尼亞州聖何塞市的ASML研發員工在幾年內將內部文件傳遞給XTAL，後者是其母公司得到國家支持的競爭對手。美國一家法院去年判決XTAL向ASML支付了2.3億美元的賠償金，但其與中國政府的聯繫在當時並不明確。 </p><p> ASML不享有蘋果公司，英特爾公司或三星電子有限公司的知名度，但它是按市值計算的歐洲第二大科技公司。全球的芯片製造商購買其機器，以製造進入我們的智能手機，計算機，汽車和服務器的半導體。 ASML的最大客戶是英特爾和三星，以及為蘋果生產iPhone芯片的台灣半導體製造有限公司。 </p><p>這家荷蘭公司比競爭對手尼康公司和佳能公司有一個重要優勢 -

（美國有線電視新聞網）唐納德特朗普對伊朗石油出口的打壓最大的贏家是弗拉基米爾普京和俄羅斯。甚至在國務卿邁克龐培週一早些時候正式公佈之前，這一點就變得清晰了。原油價格今年已上漲44％，漲幅近3％。 </p><p></p><p>週一，Pompeo宣布美國將終止對進口伊朗石油的國家的製裁豁免。 “我們的目標是讓各國完全停止進口伊朗石油，”龐培說。 “去年11月，我們對7個國家和台灣的製裁給予了豁免。我們這樣做是為了讓我們的盟友和夥伴[有機會]擺脫伊朗石油，並確保供應充足的石油市場。今天我我宣布我們將不再給予任何豁免。我們將歸零。“ </p><p>特朗普努力壓制伊朗，阻止其資助恐怖主義行動的能力，以及與巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）破壞伊朗核武器發展協議的行動一致。所以現在，單方面，特朗普政府宣布美國將不再允許中國，日本，韓國和其他五個國家從伊朗購買任何石油。 </p><p>此舉後幾分鐘內，油價開始飆升 - 對俄羅斯來說是一個福音，俄羅斯是世界上最大的石油供應國之一。但對於很多其他國家來說並不是那麼好 - 包括今年夏天將為汽油支付更多費用的美國駕駛者。中國是一個國家，其領導人特朗普正在為他急需的貿易協定而苦苦掙扎，對他的石油法令反應不佳。 </p><p>由於石油出口占俄羅斯商品出口總額的60％左右，佔國內生產總值的30％，因此石油價格的每一美元漲幅都會立即轉化為俄羅斯財政狀況的顯著改善。由於克里姆林宮緝獲克里米亞及其在烏克蘭東部的活動，這無法抵消美國和西歐繼續對俄羅斯實施制裁的一些影響。 </p><p>以硬美元計算，其影響更為明顯。由於俄羅斯每天生產約1,100萬桶石油，每桶原油價格每增加一美元，每年至少為俄羅斯經濟增加40億美元。此外，俄羅斯經濟部長馬克西姆·奧列甚金（Maxim Oreshkin）12月份對英國“金融時報”表示，去年俄羅斯的預算盈餘接近其GDP的3％，高於預期。這是自2011年以來首次出現年度預算盈餘。 </p><p></p><p>事實上，油價是少數幾個實際上是零和遊戲的經濟指標之一。雖然今天美國行動已經預期的油價上漲可能會刺激俄羅斯的經濟，但它們也大大增加了美國在西歐的盟友的負擔，他們每天消耗約1300萬桶石油。 </p><p></p><p>此外，歐洲的石油供應存在其他真正的威脅，特別是來自利比亞的持續騷亂，就在地中海地區，在最近的騷亂之前，該地區已經每天抽出約120萬桶石油，其中大部分都是運往歐洲的。人們擔心騷亂可能導致削減產量的一半，進一步提高油價，並再次為俄羅斯經濟提供另一個健康的推動力。 </p><p></p><p>至少俄羅斯和中國是周一特朗普禁運行動的主要受害者，多年來一直在為這一天做準備。 2018年1月，第二條俄中石油管道上線，提高了俄羅斯滿足中國石油需求迅速增長的能力 - 而且比從伊朗到最近的中國石油港的昂貴超級油輪長途航行還要便宜。 </p><p>但是，除了所有這些短期影響之外，週一決定壓低對伊朗的控制甚至更嚴重的是其他黑天鵝影響仍然可以在地平線上看到。其中包括大型跨國公司（尤其是石油公司）能夠準確預測供需 - 價格方程式，這些方程式深入研究了他們的投資決策或需要大量石油的產品定價。更不用說當美國人出去度暑假時，汽油價格突然上漲。 </p><p></p><p>最後，當然，美國還有許多地緣政治影響再次決定了世界石油市場的軌跡以及如此深刻依賴於這條道路的更廣泛的經濟學。 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>所有這些都是總統在開始這個課程之前應該考慮的問題，而且可能更難以撤消而不是實施。

</p><p>吳先生於2018年抵達該村，他說他已經實現了目標 - 但目前還不清楚習近平是否會這樣做。 </p><p>在最糟糕的情況下，一些專家擔心執政的共產黨可能只是宣布消除貧困，不管現實如何，以避免尷尬的習近平。 </p><p> “當地領導人非常認真地對待它，幾乎是以恐慌的方式。部分問題在於他們不知道該做什麼，所以他們有點抓住不同的解決方案，”貧窮專家約翰唐納森說。和新加坡管理大學副教授。 “他們把一切扔到了它身上。” </p><p>反貧困運動</p><p>在中國消除普遍貧困的夢想並非始於習近平。它可以追溯到1949年共產黨上台。“中國共產黨一開始就存在的原因是農民的不公正和貧困，”唐納森說。 </p><p>然而，據倫敦大學中國研究所所長史蒂夫曾說，毛澤東主席的經濟實驗實際上使這個國家重新回歸。 </p><p> “1949年，上海仍然是一個比香港更富裕的城市。1949年，任何一個沿海省份都比台灣更富裕，更發達。1979年，香港和台灣相繼領先，”曾說。 </p><p>毛澤東從1958年開始的災難性大躍進，表面上是通過工業化和集體化改造一個主要的農業社會的企圖。相反，它幫助造成了飢荒，造成了數千萬人的生命，並加劇了全國的貧困。 </p><p>毛澤東去世後，情況開始發生變化。 1978年，當時最高領導人鄧小平開始開放中國經濟，他的第一項改革之一就是讓苦苦掙扎的農民出售多餘的農產品以賺取利潤。 </p><p>從那時起，中國為消除貧困所做的努力令人震驚。據世界銀行統計，1990年全國有超過7.5億人生活在貧困中 - 超過60％的人口。差不多30年後的2019年，北京表示這個數字已降至1660萬。 </p><p>近年來共產黨的主要權力之一就是它已經使數億人擺脫了貧困。 </p><p>也許是因為這個原因，習還是不滿意。儘管中國主要城市如上海或北京的財富不斷增長，但中國農村的部分地區卻沒有電，淡水和充足的食物或衣物。 </p><p>在他的2015年演講中，習近平表示，他的靈感是通過他在20世紀60年代在農村工作的經歷將貧困作為一個優先事項，當時他的父親是一位著名的政黨官員，在毛澤東文化大革命期間失寵。 </p><p> “當時我和村民們一起勞作，目的是讓生活更好一點，但那比那年的天空更難，”他說。 </p><p>道路，互聯網和工作</p><p>政府的計劃大致分為兩個戰略 - 大國家政策和小規模的地方乾預。 </p><p>在國家層面，政策圍繞基礎設施支出。習近平的政府正在為這個問題投入數十億美元，僅在2019年就有190億美元用於全國各地的各種項目和舉措。 </p><p>據政府數據顯示，2018年，超過20萬公里（124,274英里）的道路建成或翻新，94％的貧困村莊與互聯網相連。 </p><p>據官方媒體報導，截至2019年初，數十家國有企業加入了這項運動，並向貧困救助計劃投入了40多億美元（300億元人民幣）。 </p><p>其中一些大型項目引發了爭議。一些省級政府被指控試圖簡單地將數百萬貧困人口遷移到新建的城市住所，以使他們擺脫貧困。 </p><p>一些年長的農村公民拒絕前往，而其他人則搬家但後來又回到了他們的舊房子。香港嶺南大學教授Maggie Lau表示，此類計劃並非總是務實。 “如果他們搬到成本較高的地區，他們怎麼能負擔這些新的生活費用？”她問。 </p><p>但在很大程度上，反貧困運動規模很小，一直落在地方官員手中。 </p><p> “鄉鎮一級的每一位地方官員（一個村莊之上的一個）都會下到每個貧困家庭，並試圖找出正在發生的事情以及為什麼人們貧窮以及如何將資源用於此，”唐納森說，用中文描述他的觀察結果。村莊。 </p><p>提出的解決方案千差萬別，但往往側重於鼓勵村民通過發展當地產業，從事電子商務和促進鄉村旅游來擺脫貧困。 </p><p>雖然唐納森表示所付出的努力是“驚人的”，但政府官員花費太多時間才開始討論貧困而不是解決當地問題。 “危險的是，這將是一個混亂的混亂，”他說。 </p><p>對於未能參與該計劃的貧困村民，也缺乏耐心。 </p><p>國家立法機構副主席吳衛華在2月的一份報告中抱怨說，有些人不想“致富”。 </p><p>報告說：“一些窮人甚至有這樣的心態，&#39;你沒有幫助，我不動&#39;。” </p><p>腐敗和污染</p><p>失敗是不能容忍的 - 政府正在關注其資金用途。 </p><p> 2018年3月，一名省長被趕出共產黨，部分原因是他未能解決其管轄範圍內的貧困問題。同年10月，在中國中西部各省進行了檢查，以檢查官員是否遵守扶貧令。 </p><p>為解決這一問題而分配的大量政府和公司資金也使腐敗的威脅不斷惡化。根據該黨的反貪機構中央紀律檢查委員會的統計，僅2018年就有超過17萬人因濫用扶貧資金而受到紀律處分。 </p><p>還有跡象表明，政府對貧困問題的激烈關注正在阻礙其另一個主要目標 - 環境保護。 </p><p> 2015年的一份研究報告發現，政府通過促進經濟來消除貧困的工作正在降低受影響地區的空氣和水質。 </p><p>鼓勵嚴重污染的行業建立商店，以犧牲環境為代價帶來就業和繁榮。或者利用自然資源獲取經濟利益。 </p><p> “經濟增長，扶貧和生態退化似乎沒有像長期可持續利用環境所需的那樣去耦合，特別是在糧食安全和獲得清潔水方面，”英中聯合研究稱。 </p><p>一些批評者還指出，政府主要關注農村而非城市的貧困，忽視了不那麼嚴重但仍然緊迫的城市困境。 </p><p> &#39;絕對自信&#39; </p><p>貴州村扶貧負責人吳說，他“絕對有信心”可以實現2020年的目標。 </p><p> “政府正在盡一切努力實現這一目標。而在微觀層面上，貧困人口的目標確實非常精確。如果整個社會都在努力，這不是問題，”他說。 </p><p>但專家和國際觀察家表示，中國的貧困目標達到了最低限度 - 城市和農村將需要做更多的工作，以確保每個人都享有高質量的生活。 </p><p>哥倫比亞大學中國社會政策中心主任秦高在2018年的一份報告中表示，政府對醫療保健和就業的支持比個人基金或電子商務措施更有用。 </p><p> “只有有效的發展措施和社會政策與服務相結合，才能幫助中國長期消除農村貧困，”她說。 </p><p>但唐納森表示，即使目標在2020年實現，他也不相信政府會放棄貧困作為一個問題。 </p><p>他說：“任何一個負責任的政府都會關注你如何幫助改善那些可能並不貧困但仍在苦苦掙扎的人的生活水平。” “我希望這將成為該黨的永久議程。” </p><p></p>',NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/cnn/1556093197782','[\"21\", \"113\",

Castro是來自德克薩斯州的民主黨國會議員。 </p><p>安德魯楊</p><p>這位企業家和前技術主管將他的競選活動重點放在雄心勃勃的全球收入計劃上。 44歲的楊希望保證所有年齡在18到64歲之間的美國公民每個月可以獲得1000美元的支票。作為來自台灣的移民的兒子，楊也在推動人人享有醫療保險，並提出一種“以人為本”的新形式的資本主義。他住在紐約。 </p><p> KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>吉利布蘭德（Gillibrand）在擔任紐約州北部的女議員時被稱為溫和派，她已經將自己變成了一個堅定的進步者，呼籲制定嚴格的槍支法並支持綠色新政。現年52歲的紐約州參議員已經領導了解決軍隊和大學校園性侵犯的問題，並敦促國會改善自己對性行為不端指控的處理。在競選活動中，她對特朗普發表了激烈的譴責。她發布了2007年到2018年的納稅申報表，提供了迄今為止最全面的2020年白宮候選人財務狀況，並呼籲她的競爭對手也這樣做。 </p><p> JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>這位67歲的前科羅拉多州州長將自己定位為具有商業經驗的中間派和經驗豐富的公務員。他是迄今為止唯一一位反對綠色新政計劃應對氣候變化的民主黨總統候選人，稱這將給政府太多的投資決策權。在他任職的兩個任期內，科羅拉多州的經濟飆升，西方國家擴大了醫療保健，通過了槍支管制法並使大麻合法化。這位前地質學家和釀酒酒吧老闆是拒絕接受公司資金的眾多候選人之一。他此前曾擔任丹佛市市長。 </p><p> JAY INSLEE </p><p>華盛頓州州長將氣候變化作為其競選活動的核心問題。作為州長，現年68歲的Inslee已暫停執行死刑並全面實施“平價醫療法案”（通常稱為奧巴馬醫改法案），並隨之擴大醫療補助計劃，為窮人提供健康保險。他尚未確定全民醫保的立場，但確實支持綠色新政，由進步人士支持。 Inslee在2012年當選州長之前在國會工作了15年。 </p><p> JOHN DELANEY </p><p>來自馬里蘭州的前美國代表成為第一位參加2020年競選的民主黨人，於2017年7月宣布他的候選資格。現年55歲的德萊尼計劃在他擔任總統職務的前100天內專注於推進兩黨法案。他還在推動全民醫療保健體系，提高聯邦最低工資標準並通過槍支安全立法。 </p><p> TULSI GABBARD </p><p>來自夏威夷和伊拉克退伍軍人的薩摩亞裔美國女議員是第一位在美國眾議院任職的印度教徒。在為父親的反同性戀倡導小組工作並起草相關立法後，她被迫為過去對同性婚姻的看法道歉。 37歲的加巴德一直反對美國對敘利亞的干涉，並在記者Jamal Khashoggi被謀殺後抨擊特朗普站在沙特阿拉伯。她在2016年總統競選期間支持了伯尼桑德斯。 </p><p> ERIC SWALWELL </p><p>來自舊金山南部加利福尼亞地區的第三屆國會議員指出，在他參加民主黨初選競選的原因中，解決學生債務和槍支暴力問題。現年38歲的斯瓦爾韋爾是爭奪2020民主黨提名的年輕候選人之一。他曾在眾議院情報委員會任職，並成立了未來論壇，該論壇由超過25位民主黨立法者組成，他們訪問大學和社區學院，討論對千禧年選民重要的問題，如學生貸款債務和氣候變化。 </p><p> TIM RYAN </p><p>來自俄亥俄州戰場上工人階級地區的溫和的九屆國會議員吹捧他對2016年逃到特朗普的藍領選民的呼籲。他說特朗普背棄了那些選民而沒有辜負他們他致力於振興製造業。現年45歲的瑞恩承諾創造新技術就業機會，並專注於公共教育和獲得負擔得起的醫療保健。他在2016年試圖取消南希佩洛西成為眾議院民主黨領袖的努力失敗後首次引起全國關注，並認為現在是時候進行新的領導了。作為一名前大學橄欖球運動員，他還撰寫有關冥想和健康飲食的書籍。 </p><p> SETH MOULTON </p><p> 40歲的伊拉克戰爭退伍軍人和國會議員Seth Moulton於2014年首次當選美國眾議院，當時他在初選中擊敗了民主黨同胞。莫爾頓於2001年至2008年在海軍陸戰隊服役。他成為伊拉克戰爭的主要批評者，他說服役的伊拉克戰爭不應該部署到該國。他主張更嚴格的槍支法，稱軍用武器不應歸平民所有。莫爾頓支持大麻合法化，並在2016年告訴波士頓公共廣播電台WGBH，他在大學期間曾抽煙。在民主黨在2018年控制眾議院之後，莫爾頓幫助組織反對代表南希佩洛西再次成為演講者。 </p><p>瑪麗安威廉森</p><p>這位66歲的“紐約時報”暢銷書作家，勵志演說家和德克薩斯本地人認為，她以靈性為重點的運動能夠治愈美國。 1992年奧普拉·溫弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey）的一次採訪推動了威廉姆森（Williamson）為好萊塢和自助專家提供了一個“精神指南”。她呼籲為10年來的奴隸制賠償1000億美元，槍支管制，教育改革以及女同性戀和同性戀社區的平等權利。 2014年，她作為一名獨立人士在加利福尼亞州的眾議院席位中未成功競標。 </p><p> WAYNE MESSAM </p><p>現年44歲的梅薩姆在2015年擊敗了16年任職者，成為邁阿密邁阿密郊區的第一位黑人市長。他在三月份再次當選。他是牙買加移民的兒子，曾在佛羅里達州立大學1993年全國冠軍足球隊效力，然後與妻子開始建築業務。他承諾將重點放在減少槍支暴力，減緩氣候變化，減少學生貸款債務和醫療保健費用上。

Reuters','2019-04-23',1555977600000,'<p>香港 -  1938年，在一場將中國置於共產黨統治之下的長期運動中，革命領袖毛澤東寫道：“擁有軍隊的人都有權力。” </p><p>毛澤東的最新繼任者習近平已將這一格言銘記於心。 </p><p>他穿著迷彩服，自己擔任總司令，並控制了兩百萬中國軍隊 - 人民解放軍。這是中國人民解放軍最大的改革，因為毛澤東領導了中國人民解放軍內戰，並於1949年成立了人民共和國。 </p><p>習近平加速了解放軍從傳統的陸上部隊轉向海軍力量。他打破了其龐大的，毛澤東時代的軍事官僚機構。新的指揮系統直接導致習近平擔任中國最高軍事決策機構中央軍委主席。海軍，導彈，空中，地面和網絡部隊的運作領導已經與行政和培訓分開 - 這是中國和西方國防分析人士從美國軍事組織借款的結構。 </p><p> （參見交互式版本：https：//reut.rs/2Uzr9z4） </p><p>中國領導人不僅僅是改革解放軍。習近平正在採取一系列措施，改變中國和全球秩序。他放棄了改革建築師鄧小平的禁令，即中國應該隱瞞自己的力量，並把時間花在一邊。等待遊戲結束了。習近平的演講充斥著他的“中國夢”，一個古老的國家從外國入侵的羞辱中恢復過來，並重新奪回其作為亞洲主導力量的合法地位。 </p><p>這項努力包括軟實力的簽名展示：習近平數十億美元的“一帶一路”計劃，旨在建立以中國為中心的全球貿易和基礎設施網絡，以及他的“中國製造2025”計劃將國家變為高潮科技製造巨頭。 </p><p>但最大膽的一舉是他通過改造世界上最大的戰鬥力量的解放軍來擴大中國的硬實力。這種全國復興願景的核心是一支忠誠，無腐敗的軍隊，習近平要求必須準備好戰鬥和取勝。 </p><p>他在國外投入權力的努力伴隨著家庭的權力遊戲。根據官方媒體控制的媒體報導，習近平已經清除了100多名被控腐敗或不忠的將軍。 </p><p>當國家電視台播放關於解放軍“強軍”的美術紀錄片時，他的權威得到了充分的證明。在2017年系列的一個場景中，一位老人坐在軍事法庭的一張標有“被告”的桌子上，身穿深藍色民用夾克。這是前將軍郭伯雄，也是習近平清洗中被判有罪的最高級官員。他從一堆雙手夾著的文件中讀到了他對賄賂指控的認罪。 </p><p> “中央軍事委員會完全正確處理了我的案件，”曾擔任該機構副主席的郭說。 “我必須承認自己有罪，並對此承擔責任。”郭被判終身監禁。 </p><p>在一系列故事中，路透社正在探索中國硬實力對習近平手錶的快速和破壞性進展如何結束了美國在亞洲無可爭議的霸權時代。在短短二十多年的時間裡，中國已經建立了一支常規導彈部隊，可以與美國軍械庫中的導彈相媲美或超越它們。中國的造船廠催生了世界上最大的海軍，現在它統治了東亞的海浪。北京現在可以從一支彈道導彈潛艇作戰艦隊發射核武器導彈，使其具備強大的二次打擊能力。中國人民解放軍正在南海廣闊的地區加強哨所，並在必要時加強準備以武力恢復台灣。 </p><p> &#39;美國可能會失去&#39; </p><p>五個世紀以來，葡萄牙貿易商首次抵達中國沿海地區，中國擁有統治海岸外海的軍事力量。根據在職和退休的美國高級軍官的說法，中國和美國在這些海域的衝突將具有破壞性和血腥性，尤其是對台灣的衝突。儘管自冷戰結束以來幾十年無與倫比的力量，但不能保證美國會佔上風。 </p><p> “美國可能會失敗，”11月發表的特朗普政府防務戰略的兩黨評論聯合主席加里·拉格黑德說。 “我們確實處於歷史的重要轉折點。” </p><p>魯格黑德不是扶手椅理論家：一位退休的海軍上將，作為前海軍作戰部長，他一直擔任美國海軍的最高職位，直到2011年。他的警報反映了美國國防部門越來越多的觀點。在他們的報告中，他和他的同事發出了可怕的警告。美國面臨“國家安全危機”，主要源於中國和俄羅斯軍事力量的增長。 “美國的軍事優勢不再得到保證，對美國利益和美國安全的影響是嚴重的，”專家組得出結論。 </p><p>很顯然，習近平想要結束美國在亞洲的統治時代。 “歸根結底，亞洲人民應該處理亞洲事務，解決亞洲問題，維護亞洲安全，”他在2014年對外國領導人就地區安全發表講話時說。 </p><p>中國國防部，美國印度太平洋司令部和五角大樓沒有對本文的問題或其調查結果的詳細摘要作出回應。 </p><p>習近平和解放軍的說法 - 儘管其名稱中包含“軍隊”包括所有軍事部門 - 都是基於對來自中國，美國，台灣和澳大利亞的17名現任和前任軍官的採訪。許多人只會在不願透露姓名的情況下發言。它藉鑑了中國官員和與北京高級領導人有聯繫的人的記錄，他們認識了習近平和他的家人幾十年，熟悉他在黨和政府官僚機構中崛起的職業生涯。它還依賴於中國政府出版物描述習近平的政治思想，他的演講和官方紀錄片展示了他對軍隊的領導。 </p><p>在華盛頓，世界上最傑出的軍事力量正在動員起來應對。在數十年尋求參與北京將成為世界事務合作夥伴的期望之後，美國將中國視為一個戰略競爭對手，傾向於取代中國成為亞洲的主導力量。 </p><p>華盛頓在很大程度上應對這一挑戰，正在加大國防開支，重建海軍並緊急開發新型武器，特別是射程更遠的常規導彈。它正在擴大與其他地區大國的軍事關係，包括日本，韓國，台灣，澳大利亞，新加坡和印度。它正在進行一場國際外交和情報活動，以對抗中國的網絡攻擊，傳統的間諜活動和知識產權盜竊。此次活動旨在遏制中國電信公司華為和中興通訊的全球影響力。 </p><p>這場對抗發生之際，唐納德特朗普總統的政府正在發起旨在減少中國與美國巨額貿易順差的關稅戰。然而，貿易衝突得到了解決，更嚴重的風險是，更深層次的緊張局勢可能會蔓延到北京和華盛頓及其盟友之間在中國沿海激烈爭奪海域的武裝衝突。 </p><p>出乎意料的崛起</p><p>解放軍的崛起並非所有習近平都在做。早在他掌權之前，軍隊就已經從大規模但不成熟的陸軍轉變為毛澤東和他的同志，包括習的父親，在1949年戰勝國民黨。數十年的國防開支急劇上升支付了高昂的軍火庫技術武器;數百萬士兵復員。但腐敗成了地方病。 </p><p>習近平的兩位前任江澤民和胡錦濤是平民，他們在沒有解放軍黃銅支援網絡的情況下上任。根據中國和台灣的分析師和退休官員的說法，他們通過贊助，加薪和預算增加來培養忠誠度。他們說，特別是在胡錦濤的弱勢領導下，高級官員利用他們的職位來吸走資金，尤其是物流和設備預算。排名購買變得猖獗。 </p><p>根據新加坡國立大學中國軍隊學者李楠的說法，習近平繼承的軍事等級已成為胡錦濤的一項法律。 “從某種意義上說，它失去了控制，”李說。 “現在權力集中在習近平手中。” </p><p>習近平是一位所謂的太子黨，雖然他的家人在毛澤東的混亂文化大革命中遭受了分裂和迫害，但他還是中國共產黨貴族的一員。他已故的父親習仲勳是一位革命軍事領袖，在共產黨統治初期成為政府高級官員。他後來在毛澤東的動盪中被清除，然後在20世紀80年代成為中國市場改革的關鍵領導者。 </p><p>習的戲劇性積累是意想不到的。據熟悉他早期職業生涯的多名中國人說，他在共產黨和國家官僚機構中慢慢走上前，低調。 </p><p>他1979年大學畢業後的第一份工作就是擔任國防部長耿飚將軍的一名穿制服的助手。習的官方傳記將這三年的帖子記錄為“現役”。根據與領導層有聯繫的消息來源，他可以獲得機密軍事文件，包括1979年中國入侵越南的文件。他們說，他必須記住數百個電話號碼，並且不允許依賴電話簿，以防它丟失或被盜。 </p><p>然後，他開始了一系列省政府和政黨的帖子。在這些角色中，他的表現相對不起眼。例如，作為福建東南部省長，他痴迷於官方審查共產黨文件和高級領導人演講的官僚日常工作，據當時認識他的人說。 </p><p>他遠非普遍受歡迎。他在1997年的第十五屆中國共產黨代表大會期間，在黨內200人中央委員會候補成員的選舉中排名最後。 </p><p>這個不起眼的記錄似乎對他有利。據與中國領導人關係密切的消息人士透露，在擔任中國最高領導人期間，江澤民主席精心挑選習近平擔任高級職務，因為年輕人被認為缺乏野心。據一位不願透露姓名的消息人士稱，習近平也被認為是一個柔韌的候選人，因為他缺乏權力基礎。 </p><p>但作為中國最高領導人，他表現出願意在黨，政府和軍隊的高層實施激進變革。 </p><p> “當我與我的大陸朋友交談時，他們都說他是冒險者，”台灣前國防部長安德魯·楊念祖說。 “你永遠不知道他的下一步行動是什麼。” </p><p>十一士兵</p><p>從一開始，習近平的貪污清洗和忠誠的軍官晉升就明確表明他對解放軍有很大的計劃。然後，在2015年中期，他對大部分非戰鬥和行政人員進行了削減，然後對軍事結構進行了徹底的大修。 </p><p>新加坡國立大學的李說，他解散了已經變得強大，高度自治和腐敗的四個龐大的，毛澤東時代的人民解放軍“一般部門”。習近平取代了15個新機構，直接向中央軍委主持會議。 </p><p>他還取消了七個地理位置的軍事區域，取而代之的是五個聯合軍事指揮部。這些新的地區指揮部與美國武裝部隊相比，負責軍事行動，並且非常注重將空中，陸地，海軍和中國武裝部隊的其他能力結合起來，以適應現代戰爭。 </p><p>據中國人民解放軍和中國人民解放軍觀察員說，習近平還提升了青睞的指揮官，其中許多是他在福建和浙江省所知道的軍官，他在那裡擔任官員的早期職務。其他人來自他的家鄉陝西省或太子黨。 </p><p>在2017年10月的第19屆黨代表大會上，習近平進一步加強了對最高軍事領導層的控制，將中央軍事委員會從11名成員削減到7名，並將其與忠誠者一起堆放。習近平知道他們大部分來自陝西和福建。 </p><p>在他的軍事證書上，習近平利用他早期的製服服務。根據國家控制媒體的報導，在向軍事觀眾的演講中，他將自己描述為士兵變身的官員。在獨特的PLA迷彩服，帽子和戰鬥靴中，他監督了自1949年共產黨勝利以來的一些最大的軍事遊行。在最近的這些展覽中，習近平向部隊致敬，而沒有與黨內領導人和長老的常規陣容分享領獎台。 </p><p>在去年4月的一次大規模海軍演習中，習近平登上長沙導彈驅逐艦，審查了中國南海48艘戰艦的艦隊。國營電視節目顯示，海軍司令員，沉金龍中將和海軍政委，海軍中將秦勝祥在向習近平報導時受到關注並表示敬意。然後習近平下令進行演習。 </p><p>兩位海軍酋長都是習近平。據中國和西方分析人士稱，沉在習近平已經迅速晉升，超越了其他更高級的軍官。據中國官方軍事媒體報導，秦在2017年晉升為海軍後，曾與中國領導人在中央軍委的高級職位上密切合作。 </p><p> 2017年7月，習近平還在內蒙古Zhurihe訓練場舉行的大規模閱兵儀式上紀念中國人民解放軍成立90週年。他接受了遊行指揮官韓衛國將軍的敬禮，他是一名在福建任職的軍官，習近平是該省的政黨官員。在習近平的統治下不久，漢族就被迅速崛起，並被提升為指揮中國的地面部隊。 </p><p> “習近平痴迷於軍事遊行，”中國軍事和政治精英人才流動的資深觀察員，香港中文大學的教授威利·林沃拉說。 “他喜歡這些原始力量的示範。” </p><p>作為習近平軍事形象建設的一部分，該黨的宣傳機器將他描繪為負責中國從19世紀中期第一次鴉片戰爭開始的外國征服和殖民統治中恢復的決定性支點的領導者。 </p><p>在“強軍”紀錄片的開幕場景中，習近平於2012年12月8日在蛇口港登上導彈驅逐艦海口，自那年成為黨和軍事首腦以來首次駛入南海。當習近平通過雙筒望遠鏡望向地平線時，敘述者說道：“隨著軍艦穿越海浪，習近平同視著170年前西方列強打開大門的歷史迷霧中隱藏的異象。中國，開始為古代中國帶來痛苦的噩夢。“ </p><p>據紀錄片報導，噩夢在毛澤東領導下的共產黨勝利以及前領導人鄧，江和胡的經濟和軍事力量不斷增長的時期結束了。該系列節目顯示，隨著習近平的掌控，一支全副武裝的中國有望恢復昔日的輝煌。 </p><p>台灣壓力</p><p>除了宣傳之外，習近平在使用中國新軍事力量方面比其最近的前任更加自信。 2013年，中國開始在南海有爭議的南沙群島進行疏浚和島嶼建設，這個地區北京與菲律賓，馬來西亞，台灣，越南和文萊爭奪領土要求。 </p><p>根據2017年7月在共產黨中央黨校的官方喉舌“學習時報”的評論，習近平親自指導了這些舉動。 “這相當於在海上修建長城，”評論說。 </p><p>包括導彈電池在內的這些前哨基地的廣泛強化意味著中國實際上吞併了大片這片海洋。海軍上將菲利普戴維森在5月30日被任命為美國印度太平洋司令部負責人之前，曾告訴國會委員會，中國現在有能力在“缺乏戰爭”的所有情況下控制南中國海。 </p><p>習近平也在加大對台灣，日本和印度的軍事壓力。除了能夠打擊台灣的大量導彈外，中國海軍和空軍還開展了日益複雜的演習，定期環繞自治島。 </p><p>據台灣一些防務分析人士稱，這些演習旨在恐嚇台灣，並削弱必須應對這些演習的力量。 “他們顯然在台灣施加了很多強制力，”前台灣國防部長楊說。北京認為台灣是一個叛離的省份，並決心將其置於大陸控制之下。 </p><p>在回答路透社的問題時，台灣國防部表示將繼續保持監視並部署飛機和戰艦，以“確保我國的空中和海上領土的安全”。 </p><p>中國海軍和空軍也在通過日本島鏈增加部署，演習和巡邏的節奏。日本年度軍事白皮書去年表示，中國對日本各地活動的“單方面升級”引發了強烈的安全擔憂。日本政府本月報告稱，日本攔截器在過去一年中對中國飛機的爭奪次數增加了638次，比去年增加了近30％。 </p><p>日本國防部在回答路透社的問題時表示，“中國不僅擴大和加強了在東海，而且在太平洋和日本周邊海域的軍事活動”。 “這些活動似乎旨在提高運營能力和支持中國的存在。” </p><p>儘管採取了這些自信行動，解放軍內部仍然存在一些問題，即中國軍隊與美國和其他先進軍事大國競爭的能力。在眾多已發表的評論中，中國軍官和戰略家指出解放軍在衝突，技術缺陷和未能引入有效指揮和控制方面缺乏經驗。 </p><p>習近平的權力攫取和大膽的議程也給他個人，黨和中國帶來了巨大的風險。在中國，人們普遍猜測，軍隊的腐敗鎮壓以及黨和政府官員的平行清洗，至少部分是習近平對惡性幕後權力鬥爭的回應。 </p><p>在高級官員的重要聚會上出現了罕見的證據。在2017年10月的第19屆黨代會期間，當時的中國首席股票市場監管機構劉世玉指責一群高級官員在政治陰謀中被罷免，包括不光彩的前軍事首席郭伯雄。早些時候，官方軍事報紙暗示了類似的指控，沒有引用證據。因腐敗指控而被監禁的郭無法聯繫到評論。中國政府尚未對這一指控作進一步評論。 </p><p>習近平在領導這麼多強大的軍事和政黨領導人及其派係時，已經製造了許多危險的敵人。如果負債累累的中國經濟增長繼續放緩，軍費開支的急劇增加將更難以維持。 </p><p>儘管如此，習近平並沒有表現出降低他激勵中國軍隊的動力的跡象。 10月25日，他參觀了負責有爭議的南海的廣州市南部劇院指揮部。國家電視台向習近平穿著軍裝和戰鬥靴，高級指揮官穿過指揮所。據國家媒體報導，習近平告訴官員們要集中精力“準備戰爭和戰鬥”。 </p><p> （David Lague在香港和Benjamin Kang Lim的報導。由Peter Hirschberg編輯。）

</p><p>雖然他經常表達對稅收等政策的看法，但他還是將政治留給了政治家。富士康的大部分設施和員工都在中國，台灣人在那裡完成工作的最佳方式就是遠離競爭。 </p><p>現在他想成為台灣總統。郭台銘表示，他正在尋求反對黨國民黨的提名，以支持台灣海峽兩岸的和平。我相信他。我相信北京可能認為他只是台北人所需要的那種人。然而，中國領導人明智的做法是控制他們的希望。 </p><p>在宣布他的候選資格時，郭台銘將他的核心價值描述為“和平，穩定，經濟和未來。”這就是北京希望從台灣領導人那裡聽到的那種語言：這些正是它引用統一的因素。 </p><p>請注意，缺乏對民主，人權或言論自由等台灣特色的提及。雖然他沒有這麼直接地說，但是他似乎暗示他會願意遵守北京在台灣應該走的道路上的路線。 </p><p>要了解郭台銘的微積分，了解國民黨本身就很重要。儘管有改革嘗試，但從字面上看，它仍然是中國的國民黨。它試圖從更多的台灣民眾那裡獲得支持，但它的核心和靈魂仍留在中國。為了贏得國民黨的提名，郭台銘將不得不說服該黨的普通人認為他是他們的人，而不是現在的超級明星韓國宇。 </p><p>最近當選的民主進步黨的大本營高雄南部港口城市高雄市長漢最近訪問了中國，當地媒體和政界人士對此表示異議 - 這表明北京已經批准了台灣政治的這個新面孔。 </p><p>作為黨內外人，郭台銘需要超越韓，這意味著要發揮自己的兩岸資格。畢竟，與在中國僱用一百萬工人的人相比，誰更善於與中國達成交易？ </p><p>然而，我注意到關於郭台銘的另一個關鍵特點是，他有一種訣竅，讓人們相信他們想要相信的東西，而不必做出承諾，更不用說兌現它們了。 </p><p>郭台銘是一位大師。擅長與政治家談判 - 從中國省級官員到美國總統唐納德特朗普 - 他幾乎總能找到自己的方式：減稅，保證勞動力供應，圍繞環境規則進行操縱。例如，在印度尼西亞，他領導雅加達州州長Joko Widodo相信iPhone可以在該國製造。這有助於推動維多多進入總統職位。但是，未能提供富士康要求的激勵措施意味著工廠從未實現過。 </p><p>在威斯康星州，當地領導人非常渴望讓富士康工廠投入運營，他們同意了一份財務要求的清單，然後在三天內發布了六項關鍵的環境許可證，儘管民意調查顯示該州超過一半的州居民有點或非常擔心該工廠會對環境產生負面影響。 </p><p>現在，州長托尼·埃弗斯去年擊敗現任斯科特·沃克，部分原因是反富士康的情緒，他表示，他認為郭台銘承諾提供13,000個工作崗位永遠不會被保留。 Evers想重新談判。不要指望苟跳回他的私人飛機來實現這一目標。 </p><p>作為一名商人，我希望郭台銘對民主的看法也會落後於他想要獲得最佳交易的願望。但他想要的交易不一定是北京的想法。 </p><p>中國領導人不是唯一應該保持謹慎的人。富士康各實體的股票最初都認為總統苟將對公司有利。然而，他在過去40年中建立的帝國沒有繼任計劃，他之前的退休承諾從未實現過。直到今天，當我問“誰會接管？”時，沒有人能給我一個好的答案，因為郭台銘仍然是一個動手的微管理員。 </p><p>如果他要離開，那麼潛在的企業就有可能因缺乏方向而動搖。由於他的主要客戶Apple Inc.面臨著自己的麻煩，現在幾乎不是讓郭台銘分心的時候了。與週五相關的股票下跌。無論他最近的交易是什麼，目前尚不清楚它對投資者或北京都有好處。 </p><p>要聯繫這個故事的作者：Tim Culpan，電子郵件：tculpan1@bloomberg.net </p><p>聯繫負責這個故事的編輯：Nisid Hajari，電子郵件：nhajari@bloomberg.net

</p><p>喬·比登</p><p>作為民主黨總統候選人民意調查的領導者，拜登一直等到4月下旬才進入比賽 - 直接向特朗普猛烈抨擊他的出價。拜登曾在巴拉克奧巴馬總統任職八年，在美國參議院任職36年，他在民主黨辯論中是否需要一位自由派政治新人或中間派老將才能贏回白宮。 76歲的他是繼參議員伯尼桑德斯之後提名競賽中第二位最年長的候選人。自由派活動家批評他的參議院記錄，包括他的1994年犯罪行為的作者身份，導致監禁率上升，以及他與金融業的關係，這在他的家鄉特拉華州是顯著的。拜登嫉妒他的“中產階級喬”的綽號並吹捧他的工人階級根源，他在1988年和2008年的提名中未能成功競選。拜登，最近是關於與女性進行不必要的身體接觸的指控的主題，在一個視頻中承諾“更加註意”尊重“個人空間”，試圖遏制爭議。 </p><p> BERNIE SANDERS </p><p>來自佛蒙特州的參議員在2016年失去了民主黨提名，希拉里克林頓，但已經跳了第二次嘗試。在2020年的比賽中，77歲的桑德斯將不得不在一個充滿活力的進步領域中脫穎而出，兜售四年前他帶入民主黨主流的問題。他的建議包括公立大學的免費學費，最低15美元（11.7英鎊）的工資和全民醫療保健。他受益於強大的知名度和強大的小額捐贈者網絡，幫助他在比賽的第一天籌集了590萬美元。桑德斯的父親是來自波蘭的猶太移民，他在這次競選活動中表現出了更為個人化的一面，突顯了他在一個工人階級家庭中長大的掙扎。在2016年贏得少數民族選民的困難之後，他還試圖接觸黑人和西班牙裔領導人。 </p><p> BETO O&#39;ROURKE </p><p>這位前任三屆德克薩斯州國會議員於3月14日參加了比賽，並且自從向早期主要州的選民傳達樂觀信息以來，他一直專注於存儲檯面。 46歲的奧羅克去年因其創紀錄的籌款活動而名聲大噪，並且在美國參議院對共和黨現任特德克魯茲的比賽中出人意料地微弱輸掉之前吸引了大批人。奧羅克宣佈在他的競選活動的前24小時內籌集了610萬美元的籌款資金，最好的是他的民主黨對手。但隨著黨內提名戰爭的前沿政策和多元化的進步，奧羅克將面臨一個挑戰，作為一個富有的白人，他在幾個關鍵問題上比他的許多競爭對手更溫和。 </p><p>卡瑪拉哈里斯</p><p>來自加利福尼亞州的第一任參議員將成為歷史上第一位獲得提名的黑人女性。現年54歲的哈里斯是來自牙買加和印度的移民的女兒，她宣布參加紀念被殺害的民權領袖馬丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）的候選人。她對民主黨的競選產生了迅速的影響，這種競選將受到女性和少數民族選民的嚴重影響。她在競選活動的前24小時內籌集了150萬美元，並在CNN電視轉播的市政廳中獲得了創紀錄的收視率。她支持中產階級稅收抵免，Medicare for All醫療保健基金改革，綠色新政和大麻合法化。她作為舊金山地區檢察官和加利福尼亞州總檢察長的記錄已經在民主黨中受到審查，民主黨近年來在刑事司法問題上發生了變化。 </p><p> PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>這位37歲的印第安納州南本德市市長正在逐漸擺脫弱勢地位，因為他開始與年輕選民建立勢頭。他是哈佛大學的畢業生和牛津大學的羅德學者，他講七種語言，並在美國海軍預備隊服役於阿富汗。他吹噓自己是代表打擊特朗普所需的新一代領導者。 Buttigieg將成為美國一個重要政黨的第一位公開同性戀總統候選人。 </p><p> ELIZABETH WARREN </p><p>來自馬薩諸塞州的這位69歲的參議員是該黨自由黨的領導人，也是一位凶悍的華爾街評論家，他在創建消費者金融保護局方面發揮了重要作用。她把她的總統競選活動集中在她的民粹主義經濟信息上，承諾打擊她所謂的有利於富人的操縱經濟體系。她還提議取消選舉團，誓言如果當選，就會分拆亞馬遜，谷歌和Facebook，並宣誓政治籌款活動為她的出價收集現金。沃倫今年早些時候向切羅基國家道歉，因為她進行了DNA測試以證明她對美洲原住民血統的主張，這一說法促使特朗普嘲笑她稱她為“風中奇緣”。 </p><p> CORY BOOKER </p><p>現年49歲的布克是來自新澤西州和紐瓦克市前市長的參議員，他在爭奪布雷特卡瓦諾的最高法院提名方面取得了全國性的突出地位。布克是一名黑人，他將美國的種族關係和種族差異作為其競選活動的焦點，並指出歧視對其家庭的影響。他為每一位美國人，綠色新政和其他關鍵問題接受醫療保險報導的進步立場，並吹噓他對攻擊的積極性。布克吃了純素飲食，最近證實了他正在約會女演員羅薩里奧道森的謠言。 </p><p> AMY KLOBUCHAR </p><p>來自明尼蘇達州的第三任參議員是民主黨爭奪特朗普的第一位溫和派。 58歲的Klobuchar在參議院聽證會期間與Brett Kavanaugh爭吵時獲得全國關注，因為他在最高法院提名時獲得了提名。在競選活動中，前檢察官和公司律師支持替代傳統的醫療保險醫療保險基金，並對處方藥價格上漲採取強硬態度。 Klobuchar的活動報告稱其頭48小時內籌集了超過100萬美元。她的宣傳活動發布之際，有消息稱，參議院辦公室的工作人員被要求做瑣事，因此難以招聘高級別的競選戰略家。 </p><p>朱利安卡斯特羅</p><p>美國總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）領導的住房和城市發展部長將成為第一位贏得美國主要總統候選人提名的西班牙裔美國人。現年44歲的卡斯特羅的祖母從墨西哥移民到德克薩斯州，他利用家人的個人故事批評了特朗普的邊境政策。卡斯特羅提倡普及的幼兒園前計劃，支持全民醫保，並引用他的經驗來推動經濟適用房。他在他的家鄉聖安東尼奧宣布了他的出價，曾在那裡擔任過市長和市議員。他的孿生兄弟Joaquin Castro是來自德克薩斯州的民主黨國會議員。 </p><p>安德魯楊</p><p>這位企業家和前技術主管將他的競選活動重點放在雄心勃勃的全球收入計劃上。 44歲的楊希望保證所有年齡在18到64歲之間的美國公民每個月可以獲得1000美元的支票。作為來自台灣的移民的兒子，楊也在推動人人享有醫療保險，並提出一種“以人為本”的新形式的資本主義。他住在紐約。 </p><p> KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>吉利布蘭德（Gillibrand）在擔任紐約州北部的女議員時被稱為溫和派，她已經將自己變成了一個堅定的進步者，呼籲制定嚴格的槍支法並支持綠色新政。現年52歲的紐約州參議員已經領導了解決軍隊和大學校園性侵犯的問題，並敦促國會改善自己對性行為不端指控的處理。在競選活動中，她對特朗普發表了激烈的譴責。她發布了2007年到2018年的納稅申報表，提供了迄今為止最全面的2020年白宮候選人財務狀況，並呼籲她的競爭對手也這樣做。 </p><p> JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>這位67歲的前科羅拉多州州長將自己定位為具有商業經驗的中間派和經驗豐富的公務員。他是迄今為止唯一一位反對綠色新政計劃應對氣候變化的民主黨總統候選人，稱這將給政府太多的投資決策權。在他任職的兩個任期內，科羅拉多州的經濟飆升，西方國家擴大了醫療保健，通過了槍支管制法並使大麻合法化。這位前地質學家和釀酒酒吧老闆是拒絕接受公司資金的眾多候選人之一。他此前曾擔任丹佛市市長。 </p><p> JAY INSLEE </p><p>華盛頓州州長將氣候變化作為其競選活動的核心問題。作為州長，現年68歲的Inslee已暫停執行死刑並全面實施“平價醫療法案”（通常稱為奧巴馬醫改法案），並隨之擴大醫療補助計劃，為窮人提供健康保險。他尚未確定全民醫保的立場，但確實支持綠色新政，由進步人士支持。 Inslee在2012年當選州長之前在國會工作了15年。 </p><p> JOHN DELANEY </p><p>來自馬里蘭州的前美國代表成為第一位參加2020年競選的民主黨人，於2017年7月宣布他的候選資格。現年55歲的德萊尼計劃在他擔任總統職務的前100天內專注於推進兩黨法案。他還在推動全民醫療保健體系，提高聯邦最低工資標準並通過槍支安全立法。 </p><p> TULSI GABBARD

</p><p>在一個巨大的屏幕上，動畫片展示了中國公司從“紅軍”戰艦，潛艇，岸電池和飛機上發射的導彈對該航母周圍的護航船造成的破壞。在最後的齊射中，兩枚導彈落在航母的駕駛艙上，第三枚猛烈撞擊船頭附近的船體側面。 </p><p>這艘船的命運對於一個美國來說是一個明白無誤的信息，這個美國長期以來一直在其強大的航空母艦和數百個基地龐大的網絡中佔據主導地位。中國軍方現在正朝著取代美國成為亞洲最高權力的方向邁進。由於五角大樓在中東和阿富汗戰爭中耗費了近二十年的代價，中國軍隊人民解放軍（PLA）利用了一段時間的持續預算增長和快速的技術改進來建立和部署先進的武器庫。導彈。 </p><p>其中許多導彈專門用於攻擊造成該地區美軍占主導地位的航母和基地，數十年來一直保護包括日本，韓國和台灣在內的盟國。 </p><p>據美國現任和前任軍官介紹，在幾乎所有類別的這些武器中，基於陸地，裝載在罷工飛機上或部署在戰艦和潛艇上，中國的導彈在美國及其盟國的軍械庫中與其對手相媲美或表現優異。中國人民解放軍測試發射，台灣和中國軍事分析人員的知識，以及在中國國家控制媒體上發布的技術規範。

</p><p>據中國和西方軍事分析人士稱，這包括所謂的航母殺手導彈，如DF-21D，它可以瞄準航空母艦和其他在海上航行的戰艦，射程可達1,500公里。如果有效，這些導彈將給予中國一種其他軍隊無法誇耀的破壞力。儘管美國總統唐納德特朗普在2月份決定在六個月內退出該條約，但中國在這類導彈中的優勢可能會在可預見的未來繼續存在。 </p><p>中國在發展所謂的高超音速導彈方面也取得了快速進展，這種導彈能夠以驚人的速度（甚至更快）以五倍的速度進行機動。據五角大樓官員稱，目前美國沒有對這種導彈的防禦。 </p><p>中國國防部和中國航天科工集團公司沒有回答路透社關於北京導彈能力的問題。美國印度太平洋司令部和五角大樓沒有發表評論。 </p><p>導彈差距</p><p>中國不斷增長的導彈庫尚未在現實世界的衝突中得到證實，一些中國官員也在淡化他們的進步。但在特朗普政府執政期間，華盛頓已經開始將中國視為決心在亞洲取代美國的競爭對手。美國政府認為，這一現代導彈缺口正在成為冷戰結束以來美國在亞洲軍事霸權的最大危險之一。五角大樓正在爭先恐後地尋找新的武器和戰略，以對抗解放軍的火箭武器庫。 </p><p> “我們知道中國擁有世界上最先進的彈道導彈部隊，”詹姆斯法內爾說，他是退役的美國海軍上尉，也是美國太平洋艦隊的前高級情報官員。 “他們有能力壓倒我們追求的防禦系統。” </p><p>在美國總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）尋求與北京合作之際警告中國人的集結之後，法尼爾在2015年退休之前被五角大樓拒之門外。今天，五角大樓的政策更接近於他的觀點，即中國打算取代美國成為亞洲的主導力量。 </p><p>中國軍方同意他們現在可以阻止美國航空公司。路透社採訪的中國六人，包括退役解放軍軍官和一名與北京領導人有關係的人士表示，中國增強的導彈能力是一個很好的平衡器，可以阻止美國與中國海岸過於接近。 </p><p> “我們不能在海上擊敗美國，”一位退休的解放軍上校在接受采訪時說。美國有11艘航空母艦，中國祇有兩艘。 “但是，如果發生衝突，我們的導彈專門針對航空母艦阻止他們接近我們的領海。” </p><p>與曾在軍隊服役的中國領導人有關係的人也有類似的信息：“如果美國航空母艦在衝突中離我們的海岸線太近，我們的導彈就會摧毀它們。” </p><p>直接控制世界上最大的戰鬥力量的習近平，在中國導彈部隊的優勢地位中發揮了舉足輕重的作用。這一系列節目“中國的挑戰”探討了習近平如何改變人民解放軍並挑戰美國在亞洲的霸權地位。他大力推動了負責中國核導彈和常規導彈的精英部隊 - 解放軍火箭部隊 - 的聲望和影響力。 </p><p>這位中國領導人將導彈部隊描述為“戰略威懾的核心，是國家作為主要大國的地位的戰略支柱，也是建立國家安全的基石”。習近平已將高級導彈部隊的老兵帶入他最近的軍事助手圈子，因為他通過對被指控腐敗或不忠的高級軍官進行全面清洗鞏固了對解放軍的控制。 </p><p>火箭部隊一直得到執政的共產黨的大力支持。但在Xi下，曾經被稱為第二砲兵團的曾經秘密的部隊已經成為人們關注的焦點。自從他在2012年掌權以承諾振興中國這個大國以來，火箭部隊最新的核導彈和常規導彈在共產黨時代舉行的一些最大的軍事遊行中扮演了主角。 </p><p>在其中一個展示中，2015年，新型導彈的名稱，包括“航母殺手”DF-21D，被用大白色字母塗在彈丸的兩側。據西方軍事分析師監測北京的遊行情況，這些大膽的標籤直接針對外國觀眾。在2017年主持紀念中國人民解放軍成立90週年的遊行中，導彈也得到了突出展示。 </p><p>發送消息</p><p>這個精心設計的，精心設計的最新和最強大的導彈展示為習近平提供了一個背景，因為他弘揚了他作為中國最高軍事領導人的資格。測試發射，新彈頭和技術突破的覆蓋範圍主導著國家控制的軍事媒體。 </p><p>但它不僅僅是戲劇。中國能夠提供遠程常規罷工而不用擔心飛機，船隻或人員傷亡的能力是中國人民解放軍戰略下的關鍵因素。外國軍事分析人士表示，它發出一個信號，表明中國有能力抵抗干涉，因為它擴大了對大片南海的控制，加劇了台灣周邊的海空聯運，並將業務擴展到與華東地區有爭議的領土。海。 </p><p>可以肯定的是，雖然中國的導彈艦隊無可爭議地變得更加強大，但其武器的可靠性，準確性和有效載荷尚未在戰鬥中得到驗證。自1979年入侵越南以來，中國沒有參加過戰爭。相比之下，美國的空中和海上發射導彈庫已經在過去二十年的戰爭中反复嘗試和證明。 </p><p>目前還不清楚解放軍導彈系統能否在發射設施，制導系統和指揮控制中心遭受電子，網絡和物理攻擊。軍事分析人士指出，中國是否已經掌握了允許“航母殺手”彈道導彈探測，追踪和擊中遠離中國沿海的移動目標的技術訣竅仍有一些疑問。 </p><p>美國軍事指揮官和解放軍觀察員也承認，中國導彈的宣傳可能存在詭計。欺騙傳統上是中國軍事戰略的關鍵要素。根據衛星圖像專家的說法，解放軍很清楚美國和其他潛在的競爭對手將密切關注他們的測試地點。 </p><p>一些與路透社交談的退役解放軍官員淡化了中國導彈的能力。 </p><p> “美國導彈在質量和數量方面都優於我們的導彈，”前解放軍上校告訴路透社，不願透露姓名，與外國媒體討論一個敏感問題。 “如果我們真的比美國更先進，”一位中國軍事分析家說，“我們本可以解放台灣。” </p><p>儘管如此，現任和前美國軍方官員表示，他們確信，通過密切監視中國的眾多試驗射擊，解放軍導彈是一種真正的威脅。 </p><p>範圍戰爭</p><p>根據前美國海軍陸戰隊軍官，現任米切爾航空航天研究所訪問高級研究員的羅伯特哈迪克所說，導致中國導彈對美國及其亞洲盟國如此危險的原因在於解放軍正在贏得“遠程戰爭”。總部設在弗吉尼亞州阿靈頓。雖然美國正在採取哈迪克所描述的冷戰結束後導彈發展的“漫長假期”，但中國正在射擊距離，發展的導彈比美國及其亞洲軍械庫中的導彈飛得更遠。盟國。 </p><p>五角大樓已經開始公開承認，至少在導彈中，中國占了上風。 “我們今天對中國處於不利地位，因為中國擁有基於地面的彈道導彈威脅我們在西太平洋和我們的艦船上的基地，”美國駐太平洋部隊指揮官海軍上將哈里哈里斯表示在去年3月美國參議院軍事委員會作證時。 </p><p>當時，哈里斯解釋說，由於1987年與俄羅斯的INF條約禁止使用這些武器，美國無法使用類似的導彈。 </p><p>條約的限制使得美國沒有像中國的DF-26彈道導彈那樣具有相同的武器，這種導彈射程長達4,000公里，可以攻擊關島的美國主要基地。中國稱該導彈具有一種可以擊中海上移動目標的航母殺手變種。根據五角大樓的估計，美國在韓國和日本的基地屬於另一個解放軍射彈，CJ-10陸地攻擊巡航導彈，其射程約為1500公里。 </p><p>然而，特朗普政府似乎正在為美國的競爭掃清障礙。 2月1日，特朗普宣布華盛頓將退出該條約，指責莫斯科違反該協議。他在一份聲明中表示，除非俄羅斯恢復遵守，否則美國將在六個月內辭職。特朗普還說，中國有超過1000枚導彈符合INF條約所涵蓋的射程。他補充說，美國現在將開發一種根據該條約將被禁止的地面發射的常規導彈。軍事專家表示，這可能有助於抵消中國的優勢，但美國開發和部署這些武器需要數年時間。 </p><p>中國批評特朗普的聲明，外交部發言人耿爽表示，該條約在“維護全球戰略平衡與穩定”方面具有重要意義。然而，耿沒有提到解放軍自己的武器庫或中國本身不是該協議的締約國。他說，中國反對談判一項涵蓋其他國家以及俄羅斯和美國的新條約。 </p><p>這種導彈差距預示著軍事動盪。一些強大的解放軍反艦導彈現在遠遠超過部署在美國航母上的攻擊機。這意味著美國軍事規劃者正在努力解決直到最近才出現的情況：在中國大陸附近的衝突中，美國航空公司可能已經過時了。如果在接近中國時被迫在飛機範圍之外操作，那麼核動力的利維坦人的效率將大打折扣。航行太近，他們會很脆弱。 </p><p>自冷戰結束以來，美國海軍已經能夠利用其航母打擊較弱的敵人，接近足以發動空襲，相信巨型戰艦是不可觸碰的。今天，在東亞與中國發生衝突的情況下，五角大樓的計劃者和其他地區軍隊表示，他們正在努力應對自第二次世界大戰以來他們未曾見過的事情：回歸海上極具競爭性的戰爭。 </p><p>對於美國軍方來說，人們擔心的是，大量廉價的，可消耗的中國導彈有可能抵消有史以來最昂貴的戰艦。中國沒有公佈其導彈的成本。根據美國海軍的說法，現代版本的亞音，冷戰復古魚叉，美國及其盟國的主要反艦導彈，耗資120萬美元。西方軍方官員認為，中國較低的製造成本意味著它可以用更少的力量製造類似的導彈。最新的美國航母杰拉德·R·福特（Gerald R. Ford）耗資約130億美元 - 約為魚叉價格的10,000倍。 </p><p>一個猶豫不決的美國</p><p>自1949年中國執政的共產黨掌權以來，半個多世紀以來，一支龐大但技術落後的解放軍主要局限於亞洲大陸和沿海水域。旨在阻止首次打擊的一小部分核彈頭是解放軍軍火庫中唯一嚴重的遠程武器。在那段時間的大部分時間裡，美國和其他外國海軍在中國沿海海域進行巡邏，巡邏，窺探和定期航行，就像整個殖民時期一樣，中國無力阻止外國侵占其領土。 </p><p>中國新型導彈的威脅以及中國人民解放軍海軍潛艇的數量迅速增加，這意味著來自美國和其他外國海軍的軍艦現在在靠近中國大陸和台灣的一些主要水道中猶豫不定，並不常巡邏。美國海軍在亞洲的業務負責人。 </p><p>中國的統治者從來沒有公開解放軍擁有的導彈數量。但共產黨的青年聯盟共青團在2016年10月的官方推特微博賬戶上披露了一些數字。中國的火箭部隊擁有10萬名男子，擁有約200枚洲際彈道導彈，約300枚中程彈道導彈。青年聯盟稱，1,150枚短程彈道導彈和3000枚巡航導彈。 </p><p>根據美國和其他西方國家的估計，中國大約有2000枚常規導彈屬於INF導彈條約 - 足以對日本，韓國或台灣的空軍基地，港口或關鍵基礎設施發動飽和攻擊。 </p><p>除了中國擁有壟斷的INF條約所涵蓋的武器之外，人民解放軍在其軍火庫中還有其他導彈，其表現優於美國同行。其中包括兩枚超音速反艦巡航導彈，YJ-12，射程400公里，以及YJ-18，可以擊中540公里以外的目標。 </p><p>為了對抗這些導彈，美國依靠其亞音速的魚叉反艦導彈進行了改進，使其最大射程達到240公里。 “這是一個非常大的差距，”哈迪克說，他也是美國特種作戰司令部的顧問。 “在射程，速度和傳感器性能方面，中國的反艦導彈能力超過了美國。” </p><p>作為中國武裝部隊全面重組的一部分，習近平於2015年底將導彈部隊提升到陸軍，海軍和空軍的服役水平。在國家控制的媒體廣泛報導的儀式中，第二砲兵部隊更名為解放軍火箭部隊。這支部隊的兩位老兵，魏豐和將軍和張勝民將軍，現坐在共產黨的中央軍事委員會上，這是由習近平主持的最高軍事控制機構。 </p><p>另一名火箭部隊老兵高金將軍被視為中國軍隊的後起之秀。當導彈部隊被重新安置時，高智晟被任命為解放軍的新分支機構 - 戰略支援部隊，負責網絡，電子和太空戰。根據美國和中國軍事分析人士的說法，高智晟一直是火箭部隊過渡的關鍵人物，從其起源主要是核威懾，再到目前解放軍常規打擊能力的核盾和矛頭的雙重角色。 </p><p> PEARL HARBOR-STYLE ATTACK </p><p>對於美國及其地區盟國來說，首要任務是奪回範圍戰爭中的領先優勢。 </p><p>美國空中和海上發射的導彈正在擠出額外的性能。波音公司正在升級Harpoon反艦導彈。雷神公司著名的戰斧陸地攻擊巡航導彈的反艦變型 - 射程超過1,600公里 - 正在接受測試。 </p><p>美國海軍正在努力增加航母攻擊機的航程，新武器正在籌備中。洛克希德·馬丁公司在去年12月表示，在經過一系列成功試驗後，它已向美國空軍交付了第一枚新型遠程反艦導彈。這種隱形導彈也可以部署在戰艦上。 </p><p>與此同時，中國繼續提高火力。谷歌地球上的兩組衛星圖像相隔三年，展示了中國的火箭部隊如何測試其不斷增長的軍火庫。 </p><p>在其中一個，噴氣式戰鬥機的獨特形狀清晰可見在中國偏遠的沙漠中似乎是一個模擬簡易機場。這些照片於2013年中期在中國西部拍攝，顯示了跑道南端三角翼飛機的輪廓。 2016年底拍攝的照片講述了一個不同的故事。翅膀和尾部在一堆殘骸中以奇怪的角度散落。 </p><p>美國前空軍情報分析師肖恩·奧康納說：“那架飛機看起來像是被擊中了。”他現在擔任國防信息公司Jane&#39;s的主要研究分析師。 </p><p>複製品跑道的一端有撞擊坑，是O&#39;Connor和其他衛星圖像分析師確定的解放軍導彈測試範圍的一部分。在這里以及中國西部的其他偏遠地區，解放軍一直在向空軍基地，油庫，港口，船舶，通信樞紐，雷達陣列和建築物的模擬目標發射導彈。 </p><p>一些模型似乎模仿了日本和台灣的目標。根據兩名美國海軍軍官，指揮官托馬斯·舒加特和指揮官哈維爾·岡薩雷斯的2017年報告，模擬簡易機場的測試範圍的衛星圖像也表明中國正在排練日本橫須賀的主要美國海軍基地和其他重要設施的罷工。 </p><p>這兩名軍官發現了一個模擬目標，似乎是橫須賀基地內港的鏡像，是美國航母羅納德里根及其戰鬥群的主港。這兩名官員在其位於華盛頓的研究小組新美國安全中心的報告中說，該目標的輪廓與橫須賀相似，以及與美國驅逐艦相同大小的三艘戰艦的形狀。在港口。 </p><p> Shugart和Gonzalez所設想的場景喚起了美國海軍歷史上最黑暗的時刻。他們寫道，這些模型可能被解釋為珍珠港式突擊襲擊的排練。這場癱瘓的打擊沉沒或損壞了美國艦隊的關鍵部隊，造成2300多名美國人喪生，並使美國陷入第二次世界大戰。但是日本人沒有因為他們在海上而沉沒在珍珠港的美國航空母艦。 </p><p>在最近在珠海舉行的中國航展動畫中，“紅軍”並沒有犯同樣的錯誤。在紅色導彈擊中藍色力量載體之後，動畫結束時說：“防禦性反擊行動已經取得了預期效果。” </p><p> （David Lague在中國珠海和Benjamin Kang Lim的報導。由Peter Hirschberg編輯）

</p><p>投票發生在所謂的巴拿馬文件中揭露洗錢之後，該文件在國際舞台上聲名鵲起。秘密財務文件的寶庫展示了一些世界上最富有的人如何利用巴拿馬和其他國家的空殼公司隱藏他們的錢。 </p><p>儘管發生了醜聞，巴拿馬仍然是一個戰略性的商業地點，以繁忙的巴拿馬運河航線和最近擴建的國際機場為基礎。 </p><p> Laurentino Cortizo是一位66歲的在美國學習工商管理的牧牛人，他領導民意調查作為民主革命黨（PRD）的候選人。在總統馬丁·托里霍斯（Martin Torrijos）擔任農業部長的科蒂佐（Cortizo），在最近的腐敗醜聞之後，一直在誓言清理巴拿馬的形象。 </p><p>民意調查中的下一個競爭者是Romulo Roux，他是民主變革黨的54歲商人。魯克斯得到了超市巨頭和前總統里卡多馬蒂內利的支持，後者目前因涉嫌政治間諜罪而正在等待審判。 Roux在Martinelli政府期間擔任多個政府職位，包括運河事務部長和外交部長。 </p><p> Roux在競選期間強調，去年巴拿馬經濟增長率僅為3.8％，而2012年馬丁內利擔任總統時增長率為10.7％。 </p><p>前三名由一名獨立候選人完成，他通過收集數以千計的簽名進行投票。 45歲的里卡多·隆巴納（Ricardo Lombana）是一名律師，他在幾年前通過公民運動獲得了突出地位，質疑該國的有罪不罰和腐敗現象。政治戰略家說Lombana是一個長期的鏡頭，但他所獲得的關注可能使他成為2024年比賽的有力候選人。 </p><p> Lombana的活動重點是通過社交媒體鼓勵支持，而不是通過巴拿馬三大政黨候選人所青睞的昂貴的電視廣告。 </p><p>巴拿馬選民也擔心失業率上升，公立學校衰落，供水不可靠以及首都的垃圾收集不足。 </p><p>即將卸任的總統胡安·卡洛斯·瓦雷拉（Juan Carlos Varela），55歲的保守和白酒行業資深人士，可能會被人們銘記為加強中美洲國家與中國政治和經濟關係的領導者。巴拿馬於2017年與中國建立外交關係並否認台灣。 </p><p>瓦雷拉擔任總統職務，承諾打擊腐敗並降低食品價格，他的政府正在以較低的審批水平逐步減少。憲法禁止連任。政治分析家羅伯托艾森曼說，瓦雷拉最大的成就是與中國的開放。 Eisenmann告訴美聯社說，與中國的外交變暖“應該是15年前應該邁出的一步”。 </p><p>中國和美國是巴拿馬運河的主要客戶，巴拿馬運河是該國的經濟引擎。美國於1914年完成了巴拿馬運河的建設，在當時是哥倫比亞省的地峽上建立了越洋路徑。 1999年，美國將運河的控制權移交給了巴拿馬，保證運河將保持中立區，不利於一個國家而不是另一個國家。 </p><p>瓦雷拉繼續加強與中國的關係，儘管美國多年來一直要求回歸變暖的外交關係。近年來，拉丁美洲的一些國家與台灣斷絕關係，並獲得了慷慨的基礎設施投資，這是中國“一帶一路”倡議的一部分。這些事態發展在華盛頓引發了一些擔憂，即中國正在建立該地區的聯盟，可能會犧牲美國的地緣政治和經濟利益。 </p><p>艾森曼表示，“我們一直生活在美國的陰影之下，很明顯美國本來希望我們不採取這一步驟”與中國建立外交關係。 </p>',NULL,'https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/pan308-ap.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=780','[\"317\", \"102\",

Obama）擔任副總統長達8年，在美國參議院任職36年，他在民主黨辯論中是否需要自由派政治新人或中間派退伍軍人才能贏回白宮。拜登喜歡他的“中產階級喬”綽號並吹捧他的工人階級根源。 </p><p> BERNIE SANDERS </p><p>來自佛蒙特州的參議員在2016年失去了民主黨提名，希拉里克林頓，但已經跳了第二次嘗試。在2020年的比賽中，77歲的桑德斯將不得不在一個充滿活力的進步領域中脫穎而出，兜售四年前他帶入民主黨主流的問題。他的建議包括公立大學的免費學費，15美元的最低工資和全民醫療保健。他受益於強大的知名度和強大的小額捐贈者網絡。 </p><p> ELIZABETH WARREN </p><p>這位來自馬薩諸塞州的69歲參議員是該黨自由黨的領導人，也是華爾街的一位激烈批評者，他在創建消費者金融保護局方面發揮了重要作用。她把她的總統競選活動集中在她的民粹主義經濟信息上，承諾打擊她所謂的有利於富人的操縱經濟體系。她還建議取消選舉團，分拆科技公司，並宣誓政治籌款活動，以收集她的出價。 </p><p> PETE BUTTIGIEG </p><p>這位37歲的印第安納州南本德市市長正在逐漸擺脫弱勢地位，因為他開始與年輕選民建立勢頭。他是哈佛大學的畢業生和牛津大學的羅德學者，他講七種語言，並在美國海軍預備隊服役於阿富汗。他吹噓自己是代表打擊特朗普所需的新一代領導者。 Buttigieg將成為美國一個重要政黨的第一位公開同性戀總統候選人。

</p><p> BETO O&#39;ROURKE </p><p>這位前任三屆德克薩斯州國會議員於3月14日參加了比賽，並且自從向早期主要州的選民傳達樂觀信息以來，他一直專注於存儲檯面。 46歲的奧羅克去年因其創紀錄的籌款活動而名聲大噪，並且在美國參議院對共和黨現任特德克魯茲的比賽中出人意料地微弱輸掉之前吸引了大批人。奧羅克宣佈在他的競選活動的前24小時內籌集了610萬美元的籌款資金，最好的是他的民主黨對手。但隨著黨內提名戰爭的前沿政策和多元化的進步，奧羅克將面臨一個挑戰，作為一個富有的白人，他在幾個關鍵問題上比他的許多競爭對手更溫和。 </p><p> CORY BOOKER </p><p>現年50歲的布克是來自新澤西州和紐瓦克市前市長的參議員，他在爭奪布雷特卡瓦諾的最高法院提名時獲得了全國性的重要地位。布克是一名黑人，他將美國的種族關係和種族差異作為其競選活動的焦點，並指出歧視對其家庭的影響。他為每一位美國人，綠色新政和其他關鍵問題接受醫療保險報導的進步立場，並吹噓他對攻擊的積極性。布克吃了純素飲食，最近證實了他正在約會女演員羅薩里奧道森的謠言。 </p><p> AMY KLOBUCHAR </p><p>來自明尼蘇達州的第三任參議員是民主黨爭奪特朗普的第一位溫和派。 58歲的Klobuchar在參議院聽證會期間與Brett Kavanaugh爭吵時獲得全國關注，因為他在最高法院提名時獲得了提名。在競選活動中，前檢察官和公司律師支持替代傳統的醫療保險醫療保險基金，並對處方藥價格上漲採取強硬態度。 Klobuchar的活動報告稱其頭48小時內籌集了超過100萬美元。她的宣傳活動發布之際，有消息稱，參議院辦公室的工作人員被要求做瑣事，因此難以招聘高級別的競選戰略家。 </p><p>安德魯楊</p><p>這位企業家和前技術主管將他的競選活動重點放在雄心勃勃的全球收入計劃上。 44歲的楊希望保證所有年齡在18到64歲之間的美國人每月1000美元的支票。作為來自台灣的移民的兒子，楊也在推動人人享有醫療保險，並提出一種“以人為本”的新形式的資本主義。他住在紐約。 </p><p>朱利安卡斯特羅</p><p>美國總統巴拉克•奧巴馬（Barack Obama）領導的住房和城市發展部長將成為第一位贏得美國主要總統候選人提名的西班牙裔美國人。現年44歲的卡斯特羅的祖母從墨西哥移民到德克薩斯州，他利用家人的個人故事批評了特朗普的邊境政策。卡斯特羅提倡普及的幼兒園前計劃，支持全民醫保，並引用他的經驗來推動經濟適用房。他在他的家鄉聖安東尼奧宣布了他的出價，曾在那裡擔任過市長和市議員。他的孿生兄弟Joaquin Castro是來自德克薩斯州的民主黨國會議員。 </p><p> TULSI GABBARD </p><p>來自夏威夷和伊拉克退伍軍人的薩摩亞裔美國女議員是第一位在美國眾議院任職的印度教徒。在為父親的反同性戀倡導小組工作並起草相關立法後，她被迫為過去對同性婚姻的看法道歉。 37歲的加巴德因在2017年與敘利亞總統巴沙爾·阿薩德會面而受到批評。在記者Jamal Khashoggi被謀殺後，她抨擊特朗普站在沙特阿拉伯。她在2016年總統競選期間支持了伯尼桑德斯。 </p><p> JAY INSLEE </p><p>華盛頓州州長將氣候變化作為其競選活動的核心問題。作為州長，現年68歲的Inslee已暫停執行死刑並全面實施“平價醫療法案”（通常稱為奧巴馬醫改法案），並隨之擴大醫療補助計劃，為窮人提供健康保險。他尚未確定全民醫保的立場，但確實支持綠色新政，由進步人士支持。 Inslee在2012年當選州長之前在國會工作了15年。 </p><p>嘗試突破</p><p>該領域還包括幾位已經擔任公職的民主黨人，他們設法建立了一個早期籌款基地，並試圖找到突破的方法。 </p><p> KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND </p><p>吉利布蘭德（Gillibrand）在擔任紐約州北部的女議員時被稱為溫和派，她已經將自己變成了一個堅定的進步者，呼籲制定嚴格的槍支法並支持綠色新政。現年52歲的紐約州參議員已經領導了解決軍隊和大學校園性侵犯的問題，並敦促國會改善自己對性行為不端指控的處理。在競選活動中，她對特朗普發表了激烈的譴責。她發布了2007年到2018年的納稅申報表，提供了迄今為止最全面的2020年白宮候選人財務狀況，並呼籲她的競爭對手也這樣做。 </p><p> JOHN HICKENLOOPER </p><p>這位67歲的前科羅拉多州州長將自己定位為具有商業經驗的中間派和經驗豐富的公務員。他是迄今為止唯一一位反對綠色新政計劃應對氣候變化的民主黨總統候選人，稱這將給政府太多的投資決策權。在他任職的兩個任期內，科羅拉多州的經濟飆升，西方國家擴大了醫療保健，通過了槍支管制法並使大麻合法化。這位前地質學家和釀酒酒吧老闆是拒絕接受公司資金的眾多候選人之一。他此前曾擔任丹佛市市長。 </p><p> JOHN DELANEY </p><p>來自馬里蘭州的前美國代表成為第一位參加2020年競選的民主黨人，於2017年7月宣布他的候選人資格。現年56歲的德萊尼計劃在他擔任總統職務的前100天內專注於推進兩黨法案。他還在推動全民醫療保健體系，提高聯邦最低工資標準並通過槍支安全立法。 </p><p> ERIC SWALWELL </p><p>來自舊金山南部地區的第三屆國會議員指出，在他參加民主黨初選的原因中，解決了學生債務和槍支暴力問題。現年38歲的斯瓦爾韋爾是爭奪2020民主黨提名的年輕候選人之一。他曾在眾議院情報委員會任職，並成立了未來論壇，該論壇由超過25位民主黨立法者組成，他們訪問大學和社區學院，討論對千禧年選民重要的問題，如學生貸款債務和氣候變化。 </p><p> TIM RYAN </p><p>來自俄亥俄州戰場上工人階級區的溫和的九屆國會議員吹捧他對2016年逃往特朗普的藍領選民的吸引力.45歲的瑞安承諾創造新技術的工作並專注於公共教育和獲得負擔得起的醫療保健他在2016年試圖取消南希佩洛西成為眾議院民主黨領袖的努力失敗後首次引起全國關注，並認為現在是時候進行新的領導了。作為一名前大學橄欖球運動員，他還撰寫有關冥想和健康飲食的書籍。 </p><p> SETH MOULTON </p><p> 40歲的莫爾頓退伍軍人和國會議員，40歲的莫爾頓，於2014年首次入選美國眾議院。莫爾頓於2001年至2008年在海軍陸戰隊服役。他成為伊拉克戰爭的直言不諱的批評者。被部署到該國。他主張更嚴格的槍支法，稱軍用武器不應歸平民所有。莫爾頓支持大麻合法化，並在2016年告訴波士頓廣播電台，他在大學期間曾抽煙。在民主黨在2018年控制眾議院之後，莫爾頓幫助組織反對南希佩洛西再次成為演講者。 </p><p> MICHAEL BENNET </p><p>現年54歲的班納特正在為科羅拉多州參議員擔任第二個完整的六年任期，他的政治生涯集中在改善美國教育體系上。他以前經營過丹佛的公立學校。班納特在全國范圍內並不為人所知，但已經建立了一個由政治人員和捐助者組成的網絡，幫助選舉其他民主黨參議員。在1月美國政府部分關閉期間，他引起國家的注意，批評共和黨人阻止向科羅拉多州提供緊急資金。 </p><p>長期拍攝</p><p>擴大總統候選人的隊伍是一群不太可能的候選人，希望能夠讓內部人士不屑一動地擔任總統職位。 </p><p> MIKE GRAVEL </p><p>這位88歲的前參議員在2008年為民主黨提名做了一個鮮為人知的競選活動，並再次向白宮進行了抨擊。他的一個主要議題是倡導直接民主，這將取消國會的權力，並讓選民決定政策變化。 1969年至1981年，格拉維爾在美國參議院代表阿拉斯加。他在1980年的比賽中失去了連任。自離開參議院以來，Gravel一直從事房地產和金融業務。 2008年，在未能在民主黨競選中獲得任何牽引力之後，他也未能成為自由派總統候選人。 </p><p> WAYNE MESSAM </p><p>現年44歲的Messam在2015年擊敗了16年任職者，成為邁阿密邁阿密郊區的第一位黑人市長。他在三月份再次當選。他是牙買加移民的兒子，曾在佛羅里達州立大學1993年全國冠軍足球隊效力，然後與妻子開始建築業務。他承諾將重點放在減少槍支暴力，減緩氣候變化，減少學生貸款債務和醫療保健費用上。 </p><p>瑪麗安威廉森</p><p>這位66歲的“紐約時報”暢銷書作家，勵志演說家和德克薩斯本地人認為，她以靈性為重點的運動能夠治愈美國。 1992年奧普拉·溫弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey）的一次採訪推動了威廉姆森（Williamson）為好萊塢和自助專家提供了一個“精神指南”。她呼籲為10年來的奴隸制賠償1000億美元，槍支管制，教育改革以及女同性戀和同性戀社區的平等權利。 2014年，她作為一名獨立人士在加利福尼亞州的眾議院席位中未成功競標。 </p><p>共和黨人</p><p>特朗普總統是贏得共和黨提名的最佳人選，他的反對者一直批評黨派領導層努力使挑戰者無法接受。但他仍然會面對至少一個挑戰者。 </p><p>唐納德·特朗普</p><p>這位72歲的房地產大亨在他的第一個任期內服務，震驚了2016年的政治機構，當時他成功獲得共和黨提名，然後贏得了白宮。他喧鬧的政治集會和對Twitter的大量使用被認為有助於他獲得勝利。在作為局外人跑步後，特朗普正在將他的信息集中在強大的經濟和民主黨人的批評上，因為他爭奪連任。 </p><p> BILL WELD </p><p>前馬薩諸塞州州長威爾·威爾德（William Weld）正試圖在共和黨初選中取代特朗普。作為自由主義者，韋爾德在2016年未能成功擔任總統。他一直是特朗普的批評者，他說，當他發起2020年的競選活動時，“美國人民被忽視，我們的國家正在受苦”。 </p><p>

</p><p>服務和退役的海軍軍官，外交官和安全分析師表示，這意味著中國擁有一支可以從海浪下發動核攻擊的導彈潛艇部隊，現在似乎正在巡邏。這給了北京一直到最近都缺乏的東西：如果陸基核武庫受到攻擊，它將具有更可靠的“二次打擊”能力。 </p><p>請參閱此處的交互式版本：https：//reut.rs/2ZO6ar9 </p><p>經過六十年的鬥爭，掌握複雜和具有挑戰性的海底軍事技術，中國已加入美國，俄羅斯，英國和法國的核彈道導彈潛艇俱樂部。五角大樓在8月份發布的最新中國軍事年度報告中，對中國能力的最明確評估表示，北京現在擁有“可靠”和“可行”的海基核威懾力量。 </p><p>一支有效的核彈道導彈潛艇艦隊，即所謂的彈道導彈核潛艇導彈，標誌著中國核能力的巨大提升。根據五角大樓的說法，中國四艘晉級潛艇中的每艘潛艇都配備了多達12枚彈道導彈，可攜帶核彈頭，估計射程為7,200公里（約4,500英里）。這將使美國與西太平洋相距甚遠。總部設在華盛頓的戰略與國際研究中心的分析人員估計，這些導彈可飛行至少8000公里。美國認為，中國擁有多達100枚基於陸地的核導彈。 </p><p>北京增強核能力是中國領導人習近平雄心勃勃地改造世界上最大的戰鬥部隊人民解放軍的標誌之一。西方戰略家說，中國的核潛艇艦隊加劇了這一挑戰，即日益強大的中國軍隊對美國在亞洲的統治地位構成了挑戰。 </p><p> “反對方永遠不能完全確定它知道所有潛艇的位置，”彼得霍羅賓說，他是退役的澳大利亞潛艇指揮官，也是冷戰戰鬥中發現和監視蘇聯潛艇的老兵。 </p><p>中國國防部，美國印度太平洋司令部和五角大樓沒有回答路透社提出的問題。 </p><p>目前尚不清楚中國是否正在部署全副武裝的潛艇以保持全天候的威懾力，正如其他彈道導彈潛艇的力量所做的那樣。一些分析人士懷疑中國已取得如此進展。 </p><p>但美國及其盟國表現得像中國一樣。西方軍方官員私下表示，在運作方面，美國及其盟國 - 包括日本，澳大利亞和英國 - 已經在試圖追踪中國導彈潛艇的行動，好像他們全副武裝，並進行威懾巡邏。 </p><p>當被問及他們在追踪中國潛艇方面的作用時，日本和英國表示不會對運營細節發表評論。 </p><p> “中國的軍事現代化與其快速的經濟增長是一致的，”澳大利亞國防部說。 “與所有國家一樣，我們鼓勵中國對其軍事能力和戰略意圖保持透明，以便為其鄰國提供更多保障。” </p><p>不斷增長的庫存</p><p>美國太平洋司令部司令哈里哈里斯海軍上將哈里哈里斯去年告訴國會委員會說：“武裝晉級的SSBN將給予中國一個必須應對的重要戰略能力。” </p><p>這種反應似乎正在發生。美國及其盟國正在擴大其在東亞的反潛海軍部署。這包括在新加坡和日本之外加強對美國先進的亞狩獵P-8 Poseidon飛機的巡邏。 </p><p>憑藉其相對較小的核導彈力量，北京一直擔心它可能容易受到衰弱的第一次打擊。隨著中國軍事策劃者看到華盛頓在海灣戰爭，阿富汗，敘利亞和巴爾乾等衝突中使用精確制導武器，這些擔憂被放大了。 </p><p>在加強和改善其核武庫的過程中，北京是唯一一個為其庫存增加彈頭的主要核電國。中國正在研製一種空射彈道導彈，併計劃建造一種能夠攜帶核武器的遠程隱形轟炸機。隨著海基二次打擊威懾力的到位，這些計劃表明，北京最終打算將美國和俄羅斯等空中，海上和陸地核武器三合一。 </p><p>在過去二十年中，控制中國核導彈和常規導彈的解放軍火箭部隊已經投入巨資擴大其核彈頭庫存，並提高了導彈的射程和射程的準確性。據中國官方媒體報導，它還加強了對基於筒倉的核武器的保護。五角大樓和中國官方軍事出版物報導說，中國還部署了現代的公路機動導彈，對手更難以發現和攻擊。 </p><p>儘管如此，中國在整體核火力方面遠遠落後於美國和俄羅斯。斯德哥爾摩國際和平研究所估計，中國共擁有280枚核彈頭。中國沒有透露有多少彈頭被部署並準備好迎接衝突。該研究所的2018年報告稱，美國有1,750枚部署彈頭，俄羅斯有1,600枚。據報導，美國和俄羅斯各有數千枚彈頭被儲存。 </p><p>總部設在華盛頓的美國科學家聯合會核信息項目主任漢斯克里斯滕森表示，儘管活動激烈，他還沒有看到中國在其海上潛艇上裝備全副武裝彈道導彈的情報。他說，僅僅因為潛艇存在，“這並不意味著它們擁有船上的武器。” </p><p>雖然五角大樓承認中國已顯著增強其核威懾力，但並不相信中國潛艇尚未進行全天候巡邏。在1月的一份報告中，五角大樓的國防情報局表示，中國海軍需要至少五艘金級潛艇才能在海上維持持續的核威懾。中國現在有四個。 </p><p> UNDERSEA DUELS </p><p>中國和西方戰略家表示，隱藏在廣闊海洋中的一隊核導彈潛艇將有助於抵消北京的核缺陷。 </p><p>自20世紀50年代末以來，中國海軍設計師和核技術人員一直致力於建立核導彈潛艇部隊。一艘船在20世紀80年代發射升空，但從未完全投入使用。由於中國技術人員和設計師努力克服核推進技術，導彈和過度噪音的問題，這艘潛艇成為試驗台，這將使船隻更容易被對手探測和瞄準。 </p><p>為了最大限度地提高其二次打擊能力，中國的導彈潛艇必須足夠隱蔽，以便在他們駛向公海的巡邏區時不被發現。美國和其他外國海軍分析人士稱，金級潛艇比中國早期的努力有了明顯的改善，但它們的隱身性仍然低於美國，俄羅斯，法國和英國的潛艇。 </p><p> 11,000噸級的金級潛艇駐紮在中國海南島的南部海岸，靠近通往南海的深水通道。中國沿海水域的地理位置迫使北京將其導彈潛艇建在該地區，跨越世界上最重要的航道之一。 </p><p>在北方，黃海太淺，無法隱藏大型彈道導彈潛艇。東海更深，但它受到朝鮮半島，日本島鍊和台灣的限制。 </p><p>日本和美國部隊可以在日本部署先進的反潛戰艦和飛機，密切監視這些水域和通往西太平洋的航道，這些潛艇最終將在這裡潛水。中國需要到達這些水域才能對美國開火。 </p><p>相比之下，南中國海更大，部分更深，使其更適合隱蔽的潛艇作戰，據具有豐富巡邏經驗的西方潛艇艇員說。 </p><p>中國將需要將其潛艇從海南撤出，經過監視並進入菲律賓以東的海域，因為它們的導彈位於美國的驚人范圍內。根據西方潛艇艇員和軍方的說法，這是中國在南中國海開墾和加固島嶼和珊瑚礁的關鍵原因，這些島嶼正在擴大北京對這一地區的控制。 </p><p>次級艦隊的易受檢測也解釋了中國對美國及其在這些海域的盟友的監視行動的極端敏感性。 9月下旬，一艘中國驅逐艦在距離美國驅逐艦美國戰艦Deatur 45米的範圍內航行，當時美國軍艦在南沙群島巡邏，這是一個競爭激烈的島嶼鏈，近年來中國已擴大其立足點。這是過去十年中一系列親密接觸中的最新一次。 </p><p>中國現在似乎在防範外國潛艇試圖偵察和遮擋其彈道導彈艦隊。據熟悉中國海岸盟軍監視的軍官和分析人員說，隨著中國的金級艦艇出海，他們看起來側面都是水面艦艇和飛機上的保護屏，以跟踪外國潛艇。 </p><p>服役和前高級海軍軍官還指出，中國海軍最新的056A型輕型護衛艦在日本南部和菲律賓以東的主要水域進行了廣泛，頻繁的部署。 056A型是中國最先進的潛艇獵人。它能夠在地表深處牽引聲納陣列和其他聽力設備來探測敵方潛艇 - 這是中國五年前沒有的先進技術。 </p><p>根據國際戰略研究所的數據，中國還在南沙群島的島嶼上安裝了一系列傳感器，天線和衛星通信裝置。解放軍正在從空中追踪外國海底獵人。它在海南組建了一個Y-8GX6型飛機中隊，能夠在海面的大面積區域內進行磁異常。已經看到渦輪螺旋槳飛機降落在中國在南海的主要海上控股木質島。這些巡邏不是過去罕見的演習，而是現在幾乎不間斷的部署，也影響了外國戰艦。 </p><p> “我們正在尋找他們尋找我們，”一名西方軍方武官說。 </p><p>頑強的力量</p><p>三亞附近的潛艇基地現在由中央軍事委員會直接控制，中央軍事委員會是由習近平本人擔任主席的最高軍事決策機構。南中國海的新通信裝置有助於將新的指揮結構整合在一起，從而使北京更加嚴格地控制著各個船隻。 </p><p> 2017年，北京任命一位資深潛艇艇員，海軍上將袁玉白，領導負責南中國海的南方戰區司令部。據中國海軍專家稱，他的晉升清楚地表明了中國重視支持核子作戰的重要性。袁是第一位領導這種指揮的海軍軍官，這是習近平對軍事結構進行徹底改革的一部分。 </p><p>潛艇基地的商業衛星圖像可以深入了解駐紮在那裡的武裝力量。他們似乎表明導彈潛艇經常與港口的長墩並列。去年6月來自谷歌地球的衛星圖像顯示了基地的三艘金級導彈潛艇。 </p><p>這些船隻具有獨特的形狀，具有類似駝峰的結構，其中包含帆後面的導彈管，垂直結構從潛艇的船體上升起。在圖像中清晰可見：在港口旁邊的一座小山下面，似乎是地下潛水筆的部分淹沒入口。 </p><p>三亞附近基地的建設也表明解放軍有能力悄悄地裝備帶有核彈頭的潛射導彈。 </p><p>熟悉該地區衛星圖像的西方情報分析人員表示，已經完成了一條覆蓋的鐵路，這條鐵路遇到了一個山坡掩體 - 可疑的彈頭武器庫。鐵路反過來通過隧道連接到為潛艇建造的鋼筆。他們說，這意味著導彈可以裝備在潛艇上 - 無需檢測。 </p><p> （圖表：中國如何取代美國成為亞洲的軍事巨頭 -

</p><p>關於富士康對威斯康星州項目的承諾的問題已經持續數月，但是郭台銘和該項目的支持者試圖讓這些人休息。作為富士康評論家競選公職的埃弗斯說，他希望這個項目能夠取得成功，即使它比原先設想的要小。 </p><p>富士康是全球最大的電子公司，其客戶包括蘋果，亞馬遜和谷歌，計劃在威斯康星州東南部建立一家顯示屏工廠。富士康與前共和黨州長斯科特·沃克（Scott Walker）達成協議，埃弗斯（Evers）批評了去年成功競選沃剋期間向公司承諾的納稅人信貸。 </p><p>會議結束後，埃弗斯似乎退出了之前的評論，他認為富士康不會僱用13,000人。上個月，Evers表示富士康將會僱用那麼多，這是“不切實際”和“難以想像”，因為它正在縮小它正在建造的顯示屏工廠。 </p><p> Evers告訴Racine Journal Times和Kenosha News的編輯委員會，富士康創造的工作數量“可能更少，可能更多”超過13,000。 </p><p>埃弗斯說，他和郭台銘進行了一場“精彩的對話”，他們“正在建立良好的關係。”埃弗斯表示，他們還討論了隨著郭台銘離開日常運營競選台灣總統，富士康的運營將如何變化。 </p><p>在今年早些時候對其意圖進行了胡扯之後，郭台銘在與特朗普會晤後於二月重新投入該項目。據共同社報導，郭台銘說，在周三的會議期間，總統承諾將於2020年5月前往威斯康星州開始生產。 </p><p>白宮新聞秘書薩拉桑德斯在一份聲明中表示，郭台銘在威斯康辛州花了很多錢，“很快就會在那裡宣布更多的投資”。 </p><p>特朗普一直是該項目的支持者，宣稱它是“世界第八大奇蹟”，他去年夏天訪問了威斯康星州，開創性地開啟了這個項目。特朗普預示著這一發展將成為美國製造業復甦的標誌。 </p><p>但懷疑論者質疑富士康是否會履行其在該項目中的承諾，並引用其承諾的其他人，但未能在全球範圍內實現。富士康去年未能達到其工作目標，無法在威斯康星州獲得稅收抵免，並縮減了其打算建造的工廠類型。 </p><p>民主黨人埃弗斯表示，富士康希望改變與國家的合同，如果富士康花費約90億美元並僱用13,000名員工，該州承諾將在州和地方稅收抵免中提供超過40億美元的資金。 </p><p>威斯康星大會發言人羅賓沃斯（Robin Vos），其所在地區包括項目現場，他表示希望郭台銘的評論和會議能夠說服懷疑論者。 </p><p> “也許今天，州長埃弗斯已經接受了這樣一個事實，即州長沃克和共和黨人為威斯康星州談判達成了一個非常好的協議，也許直接從郭台銘主席那裡聽到，他可以接受這樣一個事實：富士康將會是一個巨大的利益對於我們的州，我們都應該慶祝它，“沃斯說。 </p><p>埃弗斯與國家首席經濟發展官員與郭台銘會面，後者促成了富士康最初的交易。郭台銘還與威斯康星州東南部的當地領導人分別會面，其中包括Vos。 </p><p>在與特朗普會面後，郭台銘告訴記者，公司仍然致力於威斯康星州。 </p><p> “我們對威斯康星州的投資已發生變化，這是不對的，”台灣媒體根據“日經亞洲評論”報導的視頻廣播說。 “我們在去年十一月十月左右暫停工作，因為那里天氣多雪，冰冷。當天氣變暖時，我們將在五月繼續工作。“ </p><p>國家氣象局的初步數據顯示，該項目所在的拉辛縣的平均氣溫在10月為54度，11月為39度。十月平均低點為41，十一月為27。 10月份沒有降雪，11月份沒有降雨量6.7英寸。 </p><p>據共同社報導，其他一項討論的內容是郭台銘上個月宣布競選台灣總統的計劃。 </p><p>據共同社報導，台灣最富有的郭台銘告訴特朗普，如果當選，他打算成為“和平製造者”，而不是“麻煩製造者”。郭台銘還告訴特朗普，他將致力於推進和平與穩定，改善台灣經濟。郭台銘告訴特朗普，他想加強台灣與美國的經濟聯繫，把經濟關係放在首位。 </p><p>桑德斯說特朗普沒有在他們的會議上討論對郭台銘運動的支持。 </p><p> ___

Roux在競選期間強調，去年巴拿馬經濟增長率僅為3.8％，而2012年馬丁內利擔任總統時增長率為10.7％。 </p><p>前三名由一名獨立候選人完成，他通過收集數以千計的簽名進行投票。 45歲的里卡多·隆巴納（Ricardo Lombana）是一名律師，他在幾年前通過公民運動獲得了突出地位，質疑該國的有罪不罰和腐敗現象。政治戰略家說Lombana是一個長期的鏡頭，但他所獲得的關注可能使他成為2024年比賽的有力候選人。 </p><p> Lombana的活動重點是通過社交媒體鼓勵支持，而不是通過巴拿馬三大政黨候選人所青睞的昂貴的電視廣告。 </p><p>巴拿馬選民也擔心失業率上升，公立學校衰落，供水不可靠以及首都的垃圾收集不足。 </p><p>即將卸任的總統胡安·卡洛斯·瓦雷拉（Juan Carlos Varela），55歲的保守和白酒行業資深人士，可能會被人們銘記為加強中美洲國家與中國政治和經濟關係的領導者。巴拿馬於2017年與中國建立外交關係並否認台灣。 </p><p>瓦雷拉擔任總統職務，承諾打擊腐敗並降低食品價格，他的政府正在以較低的審批水平逐步減少。憲法禁止連任。政治分析家羅伯托艾森曼說，瓦雷拉最大的成就是與中國的開放。 Eisenmann告訴美聯社說，與中國的外交變暖“應該是15年前應該邁出的一步”。 </p><p>中國和美國是巴拿馬運河的主要客戶，巴拿馬運河是該國的經濟引擎。美國於1914年完成了巴拿馬運河的建設，在當時是哥倫比亞省的地峽上建立了越洋路徑。 1999年，美國將運河的控制權移交給了巴拿馬，保證運河將保持中立區，不利於一個國家而不是另一個國家。 </p><p>瓦雷拉繼續加強與中國的關係，儘管美國多年來一直要求回歸變暖的外交關係。近年來，拉丁美洲的一些國家與台灣斷絕關係，並獲得了慷慨的基礎設施投資，這是中國“一帶一路”倡議的一部分。這些事態發展在華盛頓引發了一些擔憂，即中國正在建立該地區的聯盟，可能會犧牲美國的地緣政治和經濟利益。 </p><p>艾森曼表示，“我們一直生活在美國的陰影之下，很明顯美國本來希望我們不採取這一步驟”與中國建立外交關係。 </p><p>版權所有2019年美聯社。版權所有。此材料不得發布，廣播，重寫或重新分發。 </p>',NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/washingtonpost/1557044019533','[\"305\",

</p><p>施萊佛在五角大樓告訴記者，中國在彈道導彈和巡航導彈，太空，人工智能和高速導彈等高超音速導彈方面也取得了“巨大進步”。 </p><p>他說：“我們繼續看到中國試圖侵蝕美國的軍事優勢。” “它通過大量資源支持這些雄心壯志，從而轉化為真正的能力和能力。” </p><p>五角大樓多年來發布了有關中國軍隊的報導，但隨著國防部重新調整對抗中國和俄羅斯的“大國競爭”，並且不再將其主要焦點放在伊拉克和中國的反叛亂鬥爭上，他們重新強調了這一點。阿富汗。 </p><p>五角大樓發言人查爾斯·薩默斯週五表示：“正如國防戰略所述，與中國的戰略競爭將是未來幾年美國國家安全的首要關注點。” </p><p>該報告強調了對中國的擔憂，其中包括發展反衛星武器的努力，可以擊中海峽兩岸目標的遠程火箭炮系統，加深其在國外的影響，在世界其他地區建立軍事基地。 </p><p>該報告還指出，中國在新疆地區大規模拘留了100多萬少數民族穆斯林維吾爾族人，施萊弗星期五強調，安全部隊正在監禁“集中營中的中國穆斯林”。他說他認為這是“適當的描述”。 ，“鑑於”新疆至少有100萬人，但可能接近300萬公民“被拘留。 </p><p>總的來說，五角大樓似乎特別關注中國導彈的廣泛和數量。報導稱，一支特定部隊，人民解放軍火箭部隊負責監督中國的陸基導彈，包括反艦和陸地攻擊武器。 </p><p> DF-26導彈 - 有時被稱為“載體殺手”，用於對敵方航空母艦構成的威脅 - “能夠對地面目標進行常規和核精確打擊，以及對西太平洋和印度的海軍目標進行常規打擊海洋和南海，“報告指出。 </p><p>中國還擁有大約750至1,500枚短程彈道導彈，能夠發射長達621英里，大約150至450枚中程彈道導彈，可行駛長達1,864英里，以及約270至540次地面發射的陸地攻擊巡航導彈。 </p><p>施里弗說，中國“掠奪性經濟學”的記錄也越來越明顯。美國官員表示，一些國家歡迎的中國投資可以附帶條件，中國可以控制港口和簡易機場。 </p><p> “我認為我們可以提供其他選擇。我們還可以與我們的合作夥伴和盟友一起提供替代方案，“施里弗說道。”我認為我們並不關心與美元兌美元，與中國的並列比較，因為我們提供的是乾淨的，透明，無醜聞的方法使受援國人民受益，而不僅僅是少數腐敗的精英。“&#39;&#39;

The duration of the incursion - some ten minutes - suggests it was no mere navigational mistake. </p><p>Taiwan scrambled aircraft to intercept the intruders. Taiwan\'s President Tsai Ing-wen has called for Chinese warplanes that cross the maritime line to be \"forcefully expelled\". </p><p>Taiwan - of course - is seen by Beijing as an inseparable part of China; its separation from the motherland merely a temporary phenomenon. </p><p>China\'s President Xi Jinping warned at the start of this year that unification remained China\'s ultimate goal irrespective of the differences between their two political systems. He made it clear that China would not \"abandon the use of force\" and that it retained the option \"of taking all necessary measures.\"</p><p>China remains preoccupied with Taiwan. Indeed many US strategic analysts see the re-establishment of Beijing\'s control over Taiwan as the primary goal driving its military modernisation programmes. </p><p>And an important aspect here is what is interpreted in the West as Beijing\'s anti-access and area denial strategy. In simple terms, this is the development of longer-range and more accurate weapons systems to push US forces (who might be coming to Taiwan\'s aid) further out into the Pacific. </p><p>Last month - in an effort to signal that it will continue to assert its rights of free passage - the US sent a destroyer and a Coast Guard cutter through the Taiwan Strait between China and Taiwan. This inevitably upset Beijing and was equally seen by the Taiwanese as a show of support.</p><p>Washington\'s efforts to demonstrate what it terms its \"freedom of navigation\" is highly controversial in Beijing, given its expansive claims to waters in the region. </p><p>It comes at a time of rising Sino-US tensions with differences over trade, technology, and China\'s growing military assertiveness. Add in unease in Beijing over the slowdown in its economy, which many China watchers fear could lead to President Xi pursuing a more nationalist stance, and it is easy to see why fears are growing about the course of the US-China relationship. </p><p>This weekend\'s incursion by Chinese warplanes is a reminder of the dangerous Taiwan dimension as well. </p><p>It was not always thus. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s the US established what became known as its \"One-China\" policy.</p><p>It recognised the Communist-run government in Beijing as the country\'s sole legitimate government. It acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China. Taiwan is thus part of China. It downgraded ties with Taiwan. </p><p>But equally it made it clear to Beijing that the US would \"consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means\" as being of \"grave concern to the US\". The US would support Taiwan\'s self-defence and left open the possibility of coming to Taiwan\'s aid if it were attacked. </p><p>But is this policy really credible in the face of China\'s growing military capabilities? And will Taiwan continue to be happy with the mere trappings of independence rather than the real thing? Is the Trump administration sending the wrong signals to Taiwan? </p><p>Mr Trump, for example, became the first president-elect since 1979 to speak directly to Taiwan\'s president. Some in his administration want to revisit the whole \"One-China\" policy. </p><p>Beijing has seen this US president abandon arms control agreements and alter the diplomatic status quo in the Middle East over Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. They may well fear a similar shift in the US policy towards Taiwan. </p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(2,'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-47810723','BBC',NULL,'Fears over Hong Kong-China extradition plans',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,1554694314000,'<p>The Hong Kong government has proposed changes to extradition laws that could allow transferring suspects to mainland China for trial.

Most observers say there is little chance Mr Lau\'s request will be successful. </p><p>The latest proposal has come after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend, while holidaying in Taiwan together in February last year. The man fled Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong last year.</p><p>Taiwanese officials have sought help from Hong Kong authorities to extradite the man, but Hong Kong officials say they cannot comply because of a lack of extradition agreement with Taiwan.</p><p>\"Are we happy to see a suspect that has committed a serious offence staying in Hong Kong and we\'re unable to deliver justice over the case?\" Mrs Lam said on 1 April while responding to media questions. </p><p>She added that mainland China and Macau were included in the proposed change to address a \"loophole\" in current laws. </p><p>A former British colony, Hong Kong is semi-autonomous under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. </p><p>The city has its own laws and its residents enjoy civil liberties unavailable to their mainland counterparts.  </p><p>Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US, but no such agreements have been reached with mainland China despite ongoing negotiations in the past two decades. </p><p>Critics have attributed such failures to poor legal protection for defendants under Chinese law. </p><p>Reporting by Jeff Li, BBC Chinese.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(3,'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16164639','BBC',NULL,'Taiwan country profile',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,1549017809000,'<p>Taiwan is an island that has for all practical purposes been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary.</p><p>China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.</p><p>China insists that nations cannot have official relations with both China and Taiwan, with the result that Taiwan has formal diplomatic ties with only a few countries.

Most were Hoklo Chinese from Fujian (Fukien) province or were Hakka Chinese, largely from Guangdong. The descendants of these two migrations now make up by far the largest population group.</p><p>In 1895, following Japan\'s victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government had no choice but to cede Taiwan to Japan.</p><p>But after World War Two, the Republic of China - one of the victors - began ruling Taiwan with the consent of its allies the US and UK, after Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China.</p><p>However in the next few years, the leader at the time Chiang Kai-shek\'s troops were beaten back by the Communist armies under Mao Zedong.</p><p>Chiang and the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government fled to Taiwan in 1949.

China put forward a formula, known as \"one country, two systems\", under which Taiwan would be given significant autonomy if it accepted Chinese reunification. </p><p>The offer was rejected, but Taiwan did relax rules on visits to and investment in China. It also, in 1991, proclaimed the war with the People\'s Republic of China over.</p><p>There were also limited talks between the two sides\' unofficial representatives, though China\'s insistence that the Republic of China (ROC) government is illegitimate prevented government-to-government contact.</p><p>Beijing became alarmed in 2000, when Taiwan elected as president Chen Shui-bian, who had openly backed independence. </p><p>Mr Chen was re-elected in 2004, prompting China to pass a so-called anti-secession law in 2005, stating China\'s right to use \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it tried to secede from China.</p><p>In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president.

It held China\'s seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government.</p><p>But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen to about 20.</p><p>China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan\'s leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. </p><p>It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces.</p><p>Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has most of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear.</p><p>While political progress has been slow, links between the two peoples and economies have grown sharply. Taiwanese companies have invested about $60bn (£40bn) in China, and up to one million Taiwanese now live there, many running Taiwanese factories.</p><p>Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China\'s own economy.</p><p>A controversial trade agreement sparked the \"Sunflower Movement\" in 2014 where students and activists occupied Taiwan\'s parliament protesting against what they call China\'s growing influence over Taiwan.</p><p>Officially, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) still favours eventual independence for Taiwan, while the KMT favours eventual re-unification. Opinion polls show only a small minority of Taiwanese support pursuing one or the other at the moment, with most preferring to stick with the current middle ground.</p><p>Yet more and more people say they feel Taiwanese rather than Chinese. Support for the DPP increased at the January 2016 election. This was partly because of dissatisfaction with the KMT\'s handling of economic matters, from the wealth gap to high housing prices, and partly because of worries that Mr Ma\'s administration was making Taiwan too dependent on Beijing. </p><p>The US is by far Taiwan\'s most important friend, and its only ally. </p><p>The relationship, forged during World War Two and the Cold War, underwent its sternest test in 1979, when President Jimmy Carter ended US diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in order to concentrate on burgeoning ties with China. </p><p>The US Congress, responding to the move, passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which promises to supply Taiwan with defensive weapons, and stressed that any attack by China would be considered of \"grave concern\" to the US.</p><p>Since then, US policy has been described as one of \"strategic ambiguity\", seeking to balance China\'s emergence as a regional power with US admiration for Taiwan\'s economic success and democratisation.</p><p>The pivotal role of the US was most clearly shown in 1996, when China conducted provocative missile tests to try and influence Taiwan\'s first direct presidential election.

I can assure you that I, and my department, will continue to closely monitor developments in Hong Kong,\" Hunt said, according to a copy of the letter Patten shared with UK-based pressure group Hong Kong Watch. </p><p>\"It is clear that the relatively short formal consultation process has not been sufficient to capture the wide-ranging views on this important topic.</p><p>While Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, the city operates its own legal and political system, and citizens enjoy a number of freedoms not protected on the mainland. At present, Hong Kong does not have an extradition law with China, Taiwan or Macau, a situation officials in the city say has created loopholes preventing criminals from being brought to justice. </p><p>Fear that the law will allow dissidents and pro-democracy activists to be bundled over the border to China has dogged the bill since it was first suggested, however. </p><p>Business groups too have expressed concerns, prompting the government to remove nine economic crimes from the list of potentially extraditable offenses. The government also changed the minimum severity of offense from those carrying one year in prison to three. </p><p>In a statement responding to those changes, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said members continued \"to have serious concerns about the revised proposal.\"</p><p>\"Those concerns flow primarily from the fact that the new arrangements could be used for rendition from Hong Kong to a number of jurisdictions with criminal procedure systems very different from that of Hong Kong -- which provides strong protections for the legitimate rights of defendants -- without the opportunity for public and legislative scrutiny of the fairness of those systems and the specific safeguards that should be sought in cases originating from them,\" the AmCham statement said. </p><p>\"We strongly believe that the proposed arrangements will reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations.\"</p><p>Responding to reporter\'s questions about the law last month, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the extradition law was part of the city\'s \"international commitment to fight organized crime.\"</p><p>He said the foreign business community should support the effort, which \"will benefit (the) business environment.\" </p><p>\"If the accusation is that somebody may unwittingly become a political offender, then I have said repeatedly that the law at present, under our Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has clearly stated that this will not be possible,\" Lee added. </p><p>\"There is a provision to say that no matter how you purport that offense to be, if it relates to political opinion, religion, nationality or ethnicity, then it will not be surrenderable.\"</p><p>AmCham\'s statement is part of a growing chorus of condemnation of the law from multiple quarters. Critics of the law point to past situations where people have been snatched in Hong Kong and transported to China to face trial, including multiple booksellers and Chinese businessman Xiao Jianhua. </p><p>Last week, the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said the new law could enable the Chinese government to extradite reporters critical of Beijing, saying it would \"not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong.\"</p><p>\"Over the years, numerous journalists have been charged or harassed by mainland authorities with criminal allegations covered by the (law),\" it said.</p><p>\"The (law) will make it possible for mainland authorities to get hold of journalists in Hong Kong (on) all kinds of unfounded charges. This sword hanging over journalists will muzzle both the journalists and the whistleblowers, bringing an end to the limited freedom of speech that Hong Kong still enjoys.\"</p><p>The Hong Kong Bar Association has also criticized the new law, and questioned the government\'s assertion that there were loopholes in the city\'s current arrangements. </p><p></p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190408082400-hong-kong-extradition-law-02-story-body.jpg'),(2,'https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/world/commercial-passenger-airplane-crashes-fast-facts/index.html','CNN',NULL,'Commercial Passenger Airplane Crashes Fast Facts',NULL,NULL,'CNN Library','2019-04-05T01:22:38Z',1554427358000,'<p>These are commercial passenger airplane crashes with fatalities over 200 or ones that are otherwise notable.

Mar-a-Lago security subsequently admitted her.</p><p>But staff quickly became suspicious when she didn\'t know where she wanted to go inside the property. She told a receptionist she was there to attend a non-existent \"United Nations Chinese American Association\" event that evening. </p><p>After agents were alerted to Zhang\'s presence, she told them she was there to attend a \"United Nations Friendship Event\"between the United States and China, and produced what she claimed was an invitation to the event, the complaint says. But \"agents were unable to read it as it was in Chinese.\" No such event was scheduled to take place on the property at that time.</p><p>Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago on that date, though he was not on the property at the time of Zhang\'s alleged visit.</p><p>After she was detained, agents found she had multiple electronic devices including four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external \"hard drive type\" device and a thumb drive.</p><p>A preliminary investigation found malicious malware on the thumb drive, prosecutors say.</p><p>Late Tuesday, US Attorney\'s office spokeswoman Sarah Schall said the two passports Zhang was carrying were from the People\'s Republic of China. The complaint had indicated they were from the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan.</p><p>\"Information presented to the court indicates that the defendant is from the People\'s Republic of China, not Republic of China (Taiwan), and they were PRC passports,\" Schall said in an email.</p><p>When asked about the incident Wednesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said he had \"no information\" on Zhang\'s arrest.</p><p>The complaint raises numerous questions about Zhang\'s purpose on the property.

Under Prime Minister Helen Clark, New Zealand in 2008 became the first developed country to sign a free-trade agreement with China. </p><p>Today, China is New Zealand\'s largest trading partner. Two-way trade between the countries was valued at more than $19 billion (28 billion New Zealand dollars) in 2018, according to New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade. China is also New Zealand\'s second-largest tourism market and largest source of international students.</p><p>However Wellington\'s ties to Beijing have raised alarm bells with the United States, New Zealand\'s longtime ally.</p><p>Along with Washington, New Zealand is a member of the exclusive intelligence sharing community known as \"Five Eyes,\" which also consists of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.</p><p>In an extraordinary statement to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2018, former US government analyst Peter Mattis said New Zealand\'s membership should be reviewed given its relationship with Beijing.</p><p>\"Australia and New Zealand both face substantial problems with interference by the Chinese Communist Party. In both cases, the CCP has gotten very close to or inside the political core, if you will, of both countries,\" Mattis told the commission.</p><p>Juggling the relationship with the US and China has become increasingly difficult for New Zealand, with relations between the two giants souring amid US President Donald Trump\'s escalating trade war.</p><p>Tensions with Beijing reached a new level in 2018 when New Zealand\'s Government Communications Security Bureau blocked Chinese technology company Huawei from providing 5G technology to one of the country\'s major telecommunication companies, Spark.</p><p>The US has been putting pressure on its allies and diplomatic partners to ditch Huawei over security concerns, a move which has been regularly condemned by Beijing.</p><p>Speaking to CNN in February, Andrew Campbell, a spokesman for Ardern, said the relationship had suffered some \"irritation ... because of the GCSB\'s decision regarding Huawei.\" </p><p>When asked whether Huawei would be on the agenda this weekend, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang evaded the question. </p><p>Ardern on the back foot</p><p>In recent months, Ardern has found herself under greater pressure from opposition politicians and critics to defend the strength of New Zealand\'s relationship with China.</p><p>In February, Ardern was forced to deny that China was deliberately dragging out the visa process for New Zealander diplomats and postponing trips by officials to Beijing.  </p><p>The same month, local media reported an Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai was mysteriously forced to turn back to Auckland on discovering that its paperwork referred to the disputed island of Taiwan. </p><p>At the time, Ardern denied it was a \"relationship\" issue with China, saying instead it was an administrative error.</p><p>But the postponement of a major Chinese-New Zealand tourism event that same month -- which Ardern put down to a scheduling issue -- also added to speculation of a rift.</p><p>Ardern\'s trip also comes at a sensitive time for New Zealand, just two weeks after the terrorist attack against two mosques in Christchurch in which 50 people died. She even said she would be cutting her trip to China short, as it didn\'t seem \"appropriate\" to be overseas at such a time.</p><p>Following global praise for her handling of the tragedy, the New Zealand leader has come under pressure from human rights group to raise the issue of China\'s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims with Xi. Up to two million Uyghurs have reportedly been detained in detention centers in the western region of Xinjiang, according to US government reports.</p><p>\"Given I\'ve raised it before, that should give you an indication,\" she said when asked by reporters this week.</p><p>Prior to her trip, a spokesman for the Prime Minister denied again that she was concerned about the relationship with China worsening under her leadership. \"China is one of our most important and far-reaching relationships. Our relationship is mature and resilient,\" the spokesman said.  </p><p>China researcher Young agreed with the official line.</p><p>\"I think if the relationship really was deteriorating in that way, then it would be far clearer. I think China would be a lot more blunt in the message if it was wanting to send a message,\" he said.</p><p>Wider strains</p><p>Increasingly, the Pacific -- a region where New Zealand has long been a significant player -- is shaping up to be a new battleground for influence.</p><p>China has promised billions of dollars of aid and support in the region and, if it follows through, could overtake Australia as the biggest donor to the Pacific nations.</p><p>New Zealand has also been ramping up spending. Last year, the government announced it would boost aid in the region by 714 million New Zealand dollars ($484 million) as part of its \"Pacific Reset\" strategy -- a move commentators said was at least partly driven by China\'s growing influence in the area.</p><p>\"Our eyes are wide open to New Zealand\'s decreasing influence in the Pacific and we are committed to resetting our approach to working with the Pacific,\" Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said in June last year. </p><p>Despite the numerous points of friction, Stephen Jacobi, the executive director of the New Zealand China Council, isn\'t panicking. Instead, Jacobi said, the biggest fear is that tiny New Zealand becomes irrelevant. </p><p>\"The reality is we are a small country and the Chinese don\'t get up every day thinking about how they can do nice things for New Zealand,\" he said. \"That means we need to be careful in the way we do things -- but we are never going to agree on everything with China.\"</p><p></p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318181621-jacinda-ardern-march-18-story-body.jpg'),(16,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/asia/taiwan-us-military-china-intl/index.html','CNN',NULL,'Taiwan wants to buy advanced jets and tanks from the US',NULL,NULL,'By James Griffiths, Steven Jiang and Rebecca Wright, CNN','2019-03-29T03:56:01Z',1553831761000,'<p> (CNN)Taiwan wants to buy advanced new weaponry from the United States, the island\'s President Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday. </p><p>Speaking during a visit to Hawaii, Tsai said requests had been submitted to buy new F-16 fighters and M1 tanks. </p><p>The move comes after the US Defense Intelligence Agency warned in January that China had rapidly modernized its military to improve its ability to fight regional conflicts over places like Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of its sovereign territory. </p><p>\"Beijing\'s longstanding interest to eventually compel Taiwan\'s reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for China\'s military modernization,\" the DIA said in a report. </p><p>Tsai said the weaponry she had requested from Washington would \"greatly enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen military morale and show to the world the US commitment to Taiwan\'s defense.\" </p><p>In response, China\'s Defense Ministry said Beijing was \"firmly opposed to US arms sales to Taiwan and US military contact with Taiwan.\"</p><p>\"The Taiwan issue belongs to China\'s internal affairs, concerns China\'s core interest and the national bond of the Chinese people -- it allows no outside interference,\" spokesman Wu Qian said.</p><p> \"Such dangerous moves aren\'t in the interest of either side.\"</p><p>\'Aggressive approach\' </p><p>Cross-strait tensions have been on the rise in recent years, as Beijing attempts to pressure Taiwan over what it fears is growing support for independence on the self-ruled island. </p><p>Taiwan has been de facto independent from mainland China since the end of the country\'s civil war in 1949 when the losing nationalist government fled to Taipei.

The study says this effect alone could make sea levels rise 30cm (12 inches) by the end of the century.</p><p>\"That doesn\'t sound like much, but there are many large cities around the world, much built on reclaimed land, that are not more than 30cm above sea level,\" says Stephen Simpson, associate professor in marine biology and global change at the University of Exeter, in the UK. \"Millions and millions of people would be displaced.\"</p><p>But on top of that, warming oceans are causing polar ice sheets to melt faster, which will make sea levels rise even more. </p><p>Read: 15 facts about sea level rise</p><p>The combination of melting ice and expanding water could cause sea levels to rise by up to a meter by 2100. Hundreds of millions of people could be forced to leave their homes.</p><p>Rising sea levels are already causing more flooding in the US, and within the next 30 years, more than 300,000 US homes could be flooded every other week, according to research from the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>Extreme weather gets more extreme</p><p>Warmer oceans make tropical storms more intense and longer lasting.</p><p>Hurricane Harvey, which brought more than 1.5 meters (60 inches) of rain over four days in late August 2017, was made worse by unusually warm ocean temperatures.</p><p>For coastal areas already struggling with rising seas, those storms will bring even more flooding.</p><p>Read: Yes, climate change made Harvey and Irma worse</p><p>Warming temperatures also mean changing rainfall patterns. \"We\'ll probably be seeing redistributing of water vapor in the atmosphere,\" says Brad Linsley, research professor Columbia University\'s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"Higher temperatures lead to more evaporation, so parts of the earth will get wetter and parts will get drier.\"</p><p>Ocean life under threat</p><p>Coral reefs are especially sensitive to warmer seas. Between 2016 and 2017, half the corals at the Great Barrier Reef were killed by two ocean heat waves. </p><p>Almost three-quarters of the world\'s coral reefs were affected by those heat waves and experts say warmer oceans mean these sorts of die-offs will become much more common.</p><p>Another problem for sea life is that increased flooding causes more nutrients to be washed into the sea. This leads to plankton blooms and ultimately causes some parts of the sea to be starved of oxygen, making it hard for fish to live there.</p><p>Warm oceans hold less oxygen, which makes the problem worse. Simpson says some areas of Japan, Taiwan and the Baltic Sea are seeing dramatic die-offs of fish because of low oxygen.</p><p>Food security</p><p>Fish species respond to warmer oceans by migrating to cooler areas, says Simpson. But the waters in some parts of the world are getting too warm for any fish -- and that could lead to food shortages in those areas.</p><p>\"There is a severe food security risk in the tropics,\" says Simpson. \"No species are already activated to temperatures warmer than the tropics, so you could see a real crash in food fish populations. And these are places where coastal nations often have no other protein in the diet other than the fish from coral reefs.\"</p><p>Melting sea ice</p><p>Warmer seas are causing sea ice to melt. Sea ice floats on the ocean surface, so when it melts it doesn\'t affect sea levels. But it means there\'s less sea ice to reflect heat from the sun back into space, which means the planet gets warmer.</p><p>It\'s bad news for animals that depend on sea ice to survive -- including polar bears.

Finally, the 48-year-old, who requested anonymity, visited National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.</p><p>A brief physical examination by Dr. Wei Li Chen and Dr. Chia-Chieh Hsiao, physicians and researchers in the hospital\'s Department of Ophthalmology, revealed left eyelid bruising and an artfully, if painfully, distorted left pupil.</p><p>The eye\'s single opening, the pupil is an aperture through which light travels to reach the retina, a thin layer of tissue lining the back wall of the eye. The retina\'s photoreceptor cells convert light into signals sent to the back of the brain, where the visual cortex assembles the information and decides what is being seen.</p><p>The patient sat behind a slit lamp so his doctors could perform a more thorough inspection of his injured left eye. </p><p>The slit lamp, ubiquitous in eye doctor offices, is the clunky tool that requires you to rest your chin on one support and place your forehead against another while your uncomfortably close doctor peers through a microscope into your eyes. The slit lamp focuses a narrow band of light into the eyes, providing a magnified, three-dimensional view of both front and back of the \"windows of the soul.\"</p><p>This second examination of the patient\'s left eye revealed an iris \"with the upper portion sagging downward, detached from the 9 o\'clock position to the 3 o\'clock position,\" Chen and Hsiao wrote in a case study on the man\'s injury, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. </p><p>A separation of the iris like this \"can cause multiple pupils, leading to monocular double vision, blurry vision or photophobia\" (an inability to tolerate light), they told CNN in an email.</p><p>So what caused the rare injury? A rubber bungee cord that the man used to strap goods onto a motorcycle had struck him directly in the eye.</p><p>The iris is \"what we recognize as the colored part of the eye,\" explained Dr. Nicholas P. Bell, a professor of ophthalmology and visual science with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston. </p><p>\"Muscles in the iris can cause the pupil to open or close to control how much light gets into the eye under different ambient lighting conditions, similar to how you can adjust the aperture on a camera lens,\" said Bell, who did not treat this particular patient. In a dark room, the pupil opens wide to let in more light, and on a sunny day, the pupil will constrict to reduce the amount of incoming light.  </p><p>Though Chen and Hsiao saw no evidence of cataract, retinal injury or lens dislocation, the separation of the iris from the band of muscles that sits behind it easily accounted for the patient\'s blurred and double vision. This damage is known as traumatic iridodialysis.</p><p>Bell said the condition is \"relatively uncommon,\" though when it does occur, sports or work-related activities are often the cause. But there are others. \"Bungee cord and airbag injuries seem to more frequently result in traumatic iridodialysis because of the focally concentrated strong force,\" Bell said, adding that airbags save lives, and fear of this extremely rare eye injury is no reason for avoiding them.</p><p>Dr. J. Martin Heur, medical director of the USC Roski Eye Institute and associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, agreed that this injury is \"very rare, but I\'ve had a handful of people who\'ve had this happen to them.\" \"The trauma can be caused by anything that doesn\'t penetrate the eye\" but still causes \"the iris to tear at the root like that,\" said Heur, who was not involved in this patient\'s care. Balls such as golf balls are likely culprits, he said.</p><p>To repair the damage, the Taiwanese patient underwent surgery that restored the pupil shape and improved his vision.</p><p>Heur said this surgery, known as iridoplasty, is \"usually done in an operating room\" and \"is relatively short: approximately 30 minutes.\"  The procedure involves McCannel sutures, basically when a surgeon carefully sews the iris back to the inner wall of the eye.</p><p> </p><p>Heur added that after an iridoplasty, a patient has to be careful for about a week or two about lifting heaving objects or getting water in the eye. Once healed, a patient needs to be monitored regularly for life, because glaucoma can develop even years after the injury.</p><p>One year later, the Taiwan patient\'s iris remained attached with only \"mild deformity,\" Chen and Hsiao said. Though there\'s no evidence of glaucoma so far, the patient now wears glasses to help him achieve 20/50 vision in the injured eye: He needs to be within 20 feet to see what people with healthy vision can spot at 50 feet. </p><p>Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, said he saw a similarly severe injury \"after a fisherman had a steel cable snap back into his eye.\" </p><p>\"Because some of the effects of eye trauma can be asymptomatic and appear four to six weeks later, it is important to get a complete eye exam with a professional eye care provider both immediately after severe trauma and a month or two later to be safe,\" said Goldberg, who did not treat the Taiwanese patient.</p><p>Although this level of injury is rare, \"less severe iridodialyses happen more often with moderate to severe eye trauma,\" he said. When small tears occur on the very edge of the iris, they can \"lead to scarring on that area that subsequently blocks the drain of the eye, leading to higher eye pressure and glaucoma.\"</p><p>Dr. Jeff Pettey, an assistant professor at the University of Utah\'s John A. Moran Eye Center, added BB guns and exercise bands to the list of items that can cause an injury like this: \"A young flight attendant used exercise bands when she traveled, and her eye injury resulted in severe eye trauma and a blind eye.\"</p><p>To avoid a similar injury, you can read the American Academy of Ophthalmology\'s website for eye safety tips, a list that includes using protective eyewear whenever playing sports, performing home maintenance ... or using bungee cords.</p><p></p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190408141049-collapsed-iris-study-story-body.jpg'),(23,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/world/death-penalty-amnesty-international-numbers-2018-trnd/index.html','CNN',NULL,'Executions worldwide are at a 10-year low.

However, along with the general decrease of executions, there are also points of concern. </p><p>Executions in the US rose for the second year in a row </p><p>According to Amnesty International\'s report, 45 people were put to death in the United States in 2018. This is a slight increase from 2017, when 41 were executed. However, in general, the rise is actually small compared to the general downward trend. </p><p>\"There has been a slight increase in the number of executions [in the US], but it is still within historical lows,\" Chiara Sangiorgio, Amnesty International\'s Advisor on the Death Penalty, told CNN. \"Over a 10-year-period, we have seen the number of both executions and death sentences decrease.\"</p><p>The death penalty is rare in the US, but is still legal in most states</p><p>The death penalty is legal in 30 US states, but that number doesn\'t paint an accurate picture of its actual prevalence. For instance, four US states in which the death penalty is legal are under statewide capital punishment moratoriums imposed by their respective governors. Furthermore, there are several states that recognize the death penalty, but haven\'t actually executed anyone in years. </p><p>Sangiorgio says Amnesty International monitors legislative changes and leadership decisions to provide additional insight to their numbers. </p><p>\"We are seeing a few states resume executions after several years, so we find that concerning,\" Sangiorgio says. \"But the trend in the US is positive. [In 2018], Washington became the 20th state to abolish the death penalty. And we recently saw a strong example of leadership coming from California, where [Governor Gavin Newsom] recently suspended the death penalty.\"</p><p>Global and national trends account for other decreases </p><p>Sangiorgio says the historically low number of executions in 2018 was due in part to a significant drop in sentences carried out in some of the world\'s leading executing countries. For instance, Iran has historically been one of the world\'s leading executing countries, and the number of executions there dropped by more than 50% in 2018. </p><p>\"There was a significant drop in executions for drug related offenses in Iran,  because of a change in the laws from last year,\"  Sangiorgio says. Other countries that lead the implementation of the death penalty, like Pakistan and Iraq, saw an ease in unsually high numbers from last year. </p><p>And again, the numbers are only half the story. </p><p>\"There is reason for positive hopes, not only in the drop of executions, but in the number of countries that have decided to abolish the practice,\" Sangiorgio says. \"Burkina Faso, Zambia and Malaysia all abolished or moved toward abolishing the death penalty this year.\" However, she points out that other countries like Japan, Singapore and Taiwan resumed executing people after a period of inactivity. </p><p>When it comes to execution statistics, there is also a China-sized elephant in the room: Since 2009, Amnesty International hasn\'t counted the number of executions reported in China. </p><p>\"China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty; however, available information indicates that each year, thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death,\" the report reads. </p><p>Amnesty International\'s reporting also clarifies that many of their numbers are technically minimum estimates, which is why language like \"at least 690 executions\" is used . </p><p></p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150812165528-death-row-stories-botched-executions-00004405-story-body.jpg'),(24,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/politics/us-taiwan-military-training-deal/index.html','CNN',NULL,'State Department approves renewal of $500 million Taiwan military training program',NULL,NULL,'By Ryan Browne, CNN','2019-04-15T23:04:00Z',1555369440000,'<p>Washington (CNN)The State Department has approved a possible deal with Taiwan to renew a $500 million training program in the US for Taiwanese F-16 pilots and maintenance crews. </p><p>The proposed sale is bound to irritate Beijing, which has long protested US arms sales to Taiwan.</p><p>\"Today\'s notification is consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our support for Taiwan\'s ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,\" a US State Department official told CNN. </p><p>The training program is based at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and goes back several years. </p><p>The $500 million package covers the costs associated with the program including flight training, participation in approved training exercises, training munitions, supply and maintenance support, and spare and repair parts.</p><p>The proposed sale is unrelated to Taiwan\'s reported plans to purchase new F-16 fighter jets from the US, according to the State Department official.</p><p>Taiwan accused China of \"reckless and provocative\" action after two Chinese air force jets crossed a maritime border separating the island from the mainland on March 31.</p><p>The island\'s military scrambled fighter planes after it said two Chinese J-11 fighter jets crossed the border within the waters of the Taiwan Strait, known as the median line.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.</p><p> (CNN)Thirty years ago Monday, the most important Chinese mass movement of the last half-century began when Beijing students gathered to mourn Hu Yaobang, a reformist official.</p><p>Soon, massive crowds calling for change were converging on the central plazas of dozens of Chinese cities. On May 20, the government imposed martial law in Beijing, whose Tiananmen Square was the site of the largest rallies. Two weeks later, on June 4, the movement ended after soldiers fired on unarmed civilians on the streets of the capital. </p><p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has ruled the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) since its founding in 1949, has never allowed an official investigation into the killing. The massacre\'s death toll remains unknown, but at least several hundred civilians and perhaps ten times that were slain. </p><p>Thanks in part to the iconic photo of the \"Tank Man\" standing up to the armed might of the CCP, June 4 is famous around the world, but discussion of what happened on 6/4 -- known as liusi in Chinese -- remains heavily censored in China and public mourning of the victims is forbidden. </p><p>This concerted effort to blot out memory of a 30-year-old event is not unprecedented, and there are parallels in the handling of an earlier massacre across the Taiwan strait. This one, known as 2/28, took place in 1947 in Taipei, the largest city and capital of Taiwan, which is officially known as the Republic of China (ROC).</p><p>For decades, the Nationalist Party (KMT) whose soldiers carried out the 2/28 massacre prevented official investigation of the bloodshed. The size of the death toll thus remains uncertain, though it is believed to be between several thousand and 25,000. </p><p>In 1977, 30 years after 2/28, the KMT continued to ban all discussion of the event. </p><p>Two governments, two massacres </p><p>In 1977, Taiwan was still, like today\'s PRC, under one-party authoritarian rule. </p><p>A key reason the memories of the 1947 massacre threatened the KMT in 1977 and memories of the 1989 massacre threaten the CCP now is that, in each killing, soldiers touted as benevolent defenders of the people behaved like brutal invaders. </p><p>Today however, Taiwan is a democracy, and 2/28 is marked nationwide as Peace Memorial Day. What can we learn from the similarities between the massacres -- and that the KMT eventually apologized for 2/28? </p><p>After Japan\'s 1945 surrender in World War II, Chiang Kai-shek\'s forces seized Taiwan and claimed it for the ROC, which then included much of the territory of today\'s PRC. Heavy-handed efforts to subdue the island by Chiang\'s KMT were, not surprisingly, met with resistance. Tensions flared on February 27, 1947, when police struck a widow who was selling cigarettes illegally. Big protests broke out. The next day KMT soldiers fired on crowds. </p><p>Chiang\'s government denied that a massacre had occurred and stuck to this position long after Mao Zedong\'s forces drove the KMT from the Chinese mainland.</p><p>On the 30th anniversary of the massacre, a public reckoning with the event seemed no more likely than a full investigation into Tiananmen does today. But that changed. </p><p>Taiwan\'s past, China\'s future</p><p>Even though only one of the massacres can be openly discussed in the place in which it occurred, there are three ways in which thinking about 2/28\'s legacy helps put that of 6/4 into perspective.</p><p>First, by showing that the histories of authoritarian systems often take unexpected turns.</p><p>Hopes for a long-term relaxation of repression in the PRC have proved chimerical. The CCP has been remarkably resilient. But Taiwan\'s case reminds us that even resilient objects break. </p><p>The ROC was under martial law for decades. As late as 1979, the KMT used force to crush pro-democracy protesters in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\'s second biggest city. In the 1980s, however, democracy activists asserted themselves with a vigor that took many observers by surprise, and, in 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek\'s son and successor, unexpectedly reversed his father\'s policies and allowed for formal establishment of an opposition party. Martial law eventually ended in 1987.</p><p>Second, multiple forces can drive change. </p><p>Political activists, long-time officials, and other actors played important roles in Taiwan\'s democratization. This suggests the need to avoid letting PRC President Xi Jinping\'s current emphasis on control engender myopia. Even when a confident strongman is on top, it is worth keeping an eye out for forces bubbling under the surface.</p><p>Third, change is a long slog. </p><p>It\'s worth remembering that the ROC did not have its first direct presidential election until 1996.  And its first non-KMT President was not elected until 2000.</p><p>Taiwan\'s history does not tell us what will happen in the PRC in the near future, but it does give us reason to hope that policies -- including how 6/4 is remembered and discussed -- can eventually change. </p><p>The question that remains is how, and when? </p><p></p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190410130650-tiananmen-square-1989-64-banner-story-body.jpg'),(26,'https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/asia/taiwan-terry-gou-foxconn-president-intl/index.html','CNN',NULL,'A goddess inspired a Taiwanese billionaire to follow Trump\'s example',NULL,NULL,'By James Griffiths, CNN','2019-04-18T06:09:17Z',1555567757000,'<p> (CNN)Taiwan\'s richest man whose company is best known for building iPhones in China has thrown his hat into the island\'s upcoming Presidential race. </p><p>Terry Gou, chairman of electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, said Wednesday that the sea goddess Mazu had told him to \"step forward and do something for the people of Taiwan,\" according to state media.</p><p>Gou, who has an estimated net worth of $8 billion, will \"withdraw from daily operations\" at Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision, if he wins a primary election to be selected as Kuomintang Presidential candidate, according to the company.</p><p>Foxconn is the world\'s largest electronics manufacturer, providing parts for Apple, Huawei and others.

Speaking in January, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Taiwan to embrace \"peaceful reunification\" with China, saying that independence was a \"dead end.\" </p><p>Should he become president, Gou will likely be challenged with repairing this relationship, while maintaining Taiwan\'s traditionally strong ties with Washington. </p><p>He will have a better claim than many candidates for being able to do so -- Foxconn has made billions through deep involvement in the Chinese economy, where many of its manufacturing plants are based, producing electronics for many American tech companies, most notably Apple. </p><p>Gou himself also has strong ties to the United States, and has met US President Donald Trump, who has called him \"a friend of mine\" and \"one of the most successful businessmen in the world.\" </p><p>The People\'s Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, said on Wednesday that \"Gou has a unique advantage in dealing with the relations between Taiwan and Mainland, and the US.\"</p><p>Taiwan will elect its next President on January 11, 2020. </p><p>Blessings from a goddess</p><p>Gou announced his candidacy this week after visiting a temple in Taipei dedicated to the Taoist deity Mazu, guardian angel of seafarers. </p><p>Wearing a bright red vest and a baseball cap showing the flag of the Republic of China -- the official name for Taiwan -- Gou said that Mazu had given her blessing to his candidacy. </p><p>\"If Mazu says that you should step up, it is not in order to make money or for personal enjoyment,\" Gou told reporters. \"I tell you, I am like a godson to Mazu ... I will definitely respect and follow Mazu\'s will.\"</p><p>Speaking later at KMT headquarters -- still wearing his cap -- Gou said he was \"willing to participate in the primary elections.\"</p><p>\"I am not willing to accept being appointed (without being elected), I am definitely not willing to accept being appointed. If elected, I will represent the Kuomintang in the 2020 contest,\" he said. \"If I am not elected, it means that I didn\'t try hard enough.\"</p><p>In a statement, Foxconn said Gou would only run for president, \"if the primary process - which is still being determined by party leadership - is open, transparent, and grounded.\"</p><p>\"When and if this determination is made, Mr. Gou will run in the KMT\'s primary to seek the party nomination for President,\" a spokeswoman said. </p><p>As well as Mazu, Gou may have been inspired by another source: Trump. According to multiple media reports, the Foxconn chairman is rumored to have been inspired by Trump\'s 2016 run and began thinking that he too could be President. </p><p>Margaret Lewis, a Taiwan expert at the Seton Hall University School of Law, compared Gou\'s candidacy to Trump\'s, and warned against underestimating the Taiwanese billionaire. </p><p>\"Even though he\'s obviously flawed in many ways as a candidate, populism can be powerful,\" she said. \"It would be a mistake to treat his run too lightly.\" </p><p>While Gou is definitely an outsider candidate -- according to state media, he hasn\'t been a KMT member since 2000 -- he\'s received backing from key party figures, with former leader and President of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, saying he was \"an ideal candidate.\" </p><p>Lev Nachman, an expert on Taiwanese politics at the University of California, Irvine, said that Gou had one thing in particular that the KMT needs: Funding. </p><p>\"Terry Gou is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Taiwan and would essentially be able to finance his own campaign,\" he said. \"That\'s a big deal for the KMT right now.\"</p><p> </p><p>Support from Beijing?</p><p>Despite once fighting a civil war with the Communist Party for rule over China -- before defeat forced the Republic of China government to retreat to Taiwan -- the KMT has in recent decades been the party of closer ties and engagement with Beijing. </p><p>Former President Ma held historic talks with China\'s Xi in 2015, and his administration massively ramped up cross-straits economic activity, including a controversial trade deal that sparked mass protests known as the Sunflower Movement, which are credited with helping carry Tsai and her DPP to the presidency. </p><p>Gou\'s connections to China are manifold. His company Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people in factories and manufacturing plants across China. </p><p>\"Gou is an integral player in the Chinese economy and becoming president would put him in a position to very closely tie Taiwan into China\'s economy in ways Tsai has fought against such as her New Southbound Policy which tried to extend Taiwan\'s trade beyond just China,\" Nachman said. </p><p>Foxconn could also be a potential concern for voters, however. </p><p>So far, the company has been tight-lipped over what a Gou run for president will exactly mean for his relations with the company he founded. </p><p>A spokeswoman said that at present Gou remains chairman, and would \"continue to provide strategic direction and guidance,\" as he seeks the KMT nomination. </p><p>\"That\'s the million dollar question. Who is Gou loyal to? Taiwan? Foxconn? Both? If the answer is Foxconn or both, that puts Taiwan in a bad position with Gou as president because Foxconn\'s success is tied to, coercively or not, the Chinese state,\" Nachman said. </p><p>\"In the same way Trump only marginally divested from his assets when he became president, I would not expect Gou to truly move away from his (company),\" he added. </p><p>\"I would be greatly concerned with Gou\'s ability to separate his business from his political endeavors. Given Foxconn\'s position within the Chinese economy and Gou\'s political ideals, I\'m not sure he even can or wants to.\"</p><p>Lewis, the Seton Hall professor, also cautioned against assuming that Gou -- or any other KMT President -- would be able to magically fix relations with Beijing. </p><p>\"Ma Ying-jeou met with Xi Jinping, but I don\'t think it\'s fair to compare the Xi Jinping of 2013 with the Xi Jinping of 2019,\" she said. \"He\'s been able to take on a more assertive position in recent years.\" </p><p>Can he win? </p><p>Gou has said repeatedly that he does not want to be simply anointed as KMT candidate, and will fight the party\'s primary. </p><p>This could be a close run for the billionaire, with multiple other candidates and potential candidates, including Han Kuo-yu, who Gou himself previously said would be a \"terrific\" president. </p><p>Han, a hugely popular KMT mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, has not officially announced his candidacy, but had been seen in recent weeks as frontrunner to be the party\'s eventual pick. He recently toured the US, meeting with lawmakers and business leaders, a traditional first step to declaring a run for president. </p><p>\"Han Kuo-yu is a very interesting, unusual person,\" Lewis said. \"He has has not set forth clear policies, going with a much more flashy, \'I\'m something different even if you don\'t know what that is\' approach.\" </p><p>As Kaohsiung mayor, Han has increased engagement with China, and would be expected to follow a similar path to Gou\'s, which Lewis described as a \"general willingness to engage with China, particularly economically, and a belief that that engagement can be confined to the economic.\" </p><p>\"Han does currently have an unmatched level of popularity in Taiwan right now,\" Nachman said. \"Han has also shown, especially during his most recent trip to Hong Kong, that he, like Gou, is willing to build strong connections to the CCP and push for a more pro-unification agenda.\" </p><p>With both Gou and Han favoring closer ties with China, Nachman said there was even a small possibility they could end up working together, on a ticket that could dramatically reshape politics both within the KMT and Taiwan at large. </p><p>\"That would be the most blatantly pro-unification team to ever be seriously considered for presidential leadership,\" he said. \"It could very much lead to the end of the current status quo as we know it.\" </p><p></p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190417234154-0417-terry-gou-02-story-body.jpg');

She is well-liked abroad for her reluctance to pick fights with China. But she is not popular at home. Recent polls put her approval rating below 30%. Her bid for re-election next year, already iffy, just got iffier. Lai Ching-te, her former prime minister, has declared that he will challenge Ms Tsai for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). It is the first time an incumbent president in Taiwan has been subjected to a primary. And the contest may anger China, since Mr Lai is a more vocal supporter than Ms Tsai of the idea that Taiwan should formally declare itself to be a distinct country from China—a move China says would be grounds for war.  </p><p>“Taiwan doesn’t want to be a second Hong Kong or Tibet,” declared Mr Lai as he registered for the primary this week, insinuating that Ms Tsai is not doing enough to ensure Taiwan’s independence. The DPP was thrashed in municipal elections in November by the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, which advocates warmer relations with China. Voters seemed disappointed that Ms Tsai’s efforts to stimulate the economy have had scant success. Growth is slowing. Wages have been stagnant for decades.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Following the defeat in November, Ms Tsai stepped down as leader of the DPP. A month later Mr Lai, a former mayor of the southern city of Tainan, resigned as prime minister, spurning Ms Tsai’s entreaties for him to stay. The primary will involve the two candidates giving televised presentations of their platforms, after which the party conducts an opinion poll of a sample of the whole electorate. The more popular candidate wins the nomination. The results will be announced on April 17th.</p><p>DPP activists had been panicking, as Ms Tsai has been trailing badly in the polls. They feared not only a further electoral setback, but one that would have put the government into the hands of a China-friendly leader just as China is pressing Taiwan to begin talks on unification. Some advocates of independence, fed up with Ms Tsai’s caution, are jubilant at Mr Lai’s announcement, both because they think Mr Lai has a better chance of winning and because they think he might be more assertive.</p><p>Ms Tsai’s supporters, meanwhile, are arguing that the primary could split the party and are making agonised calls for unity, by which they seem to mean Mr Lai’s withdrawal. Chen Chi-mai, the deputy prime minister and a supporter of Ms Tsai, argued in a Facebook post that China’s growing assertiveness makes divisions within the party especially dangerous. “The 2020 election will determine whether Taiwan survives or is extinguished,” he said. </p><p>Luckily for the DPP, the KMT also has no anointed candidate and its primary is still some months away. A former mayor of New Taipei City, Eric Chu, and a former speaker of parliament, Wang Jin-pyng, have both said they will run. The election will probably also feature an independent candidate, Ko Wen-je, the popular mayor of Taipei.  </p><p> Inevitably, China will be front and centre in the campaign. The authorities across the Taiwan Strait probably revile Mr Lai even more than they do Ms Tsai. That might encourage them to ease the pressure on Taiwan a bit over the next few months. The Chinese government knows from experience that attempts to intimidate Taiwanese voters tend to backfire, prompting them to back the candidate most hostile to its cherished goal of reunification.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687929'),(2,'https://www.economist.com/china/2019/02/09/does-china-understand-taiwan','The Economist',NULL,'Does China understand Taiwan?','Ostracism of pro-independence Taiwanese is dangerous and counterproductive',NULL,'','2019-02-09T00:00:00Z',1549670400000,'<p></p><p>IF CHINA’S RULERS ever decide to invade Taiwan—a grim but not impossible prospect—they will need good answers to two questions. First, would the People’s Liberation Army win? The consensus in Taipei is that the PLA is close to that goal but is not “100% sure” of victory. Second, would ordinary Taiwanese submit?</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Chinese leaders have limited patience for Taiwanese opinion. Their offer to the democratic island of 23m is ostensibly generous. Under the slogan “One Country, Two Systems”, Taiwan is promised lots of autonomy alongside access to China’s vast market. This is backed by honeyed words about unifying a family sundered for 70 years, since China’s civil war ended with the losing Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT) retreating to what they hoped would be temporary exile on Taiwan. Still, China is committed to using force to block any bid for formal independence.</p><p>Chinese optimists call time their ally, as Taiwan’s population ages and its economy slows. Chaguan visited Taiwan recently. It is true that China’s gleaming coastal cities make Taipei’s 1980s skyscrapers look shabby. But time is China’s foe too, says Freddy Lim, a heavy-metal rock star and legislator for Taiwan’s pro-independence New Power Party. Mr Lim cites polls showing that youngsters increasingly identify as Taiwanese and consider China another country, albeit one where they like to do business.</p><p>Put bluntly, China’s proposals sound creepy to many young, urban Taiwanese. In effect, they hear a demand to submit to marriage with a stern cousin, arranged decades ago: “I am rich now, let me cherish you—or I will kill you.”</p><p>Taiwanese defiance may anger China’s leaders. But they cannot safely ignore it. Any Chinese victory would need to be quick, with Taiwan’s will to fight broken so swiftly that calls for an American rescue become moot. Taiwanese security experts are frank about what they fear: a psychological collapse among the public, for instance after initial waves of Chinese missiles wreck more than half the island’s defences, or blow up oil and gas terminals to cut power supplies. Then there is the question of what happens the day after China wins. Politicians predict mass protests in Taiwanese cities. Would China send tanks to subdue its sullen new satrapy?</p><p>Alas, China has closed off avenues to answering such questions. Communist bosses growl that they will only engage with Taiwanese who agree that their island is part of China. That excludes President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The DPP says that the island they govern is a country in its own right, though to avoid a crisis they fudge what they mean by that. In their desire to teach Taiwanese voters that DPP rule brings pain and isolation, China has sought to ostracise the party since Ms Tsai won election in 2016. Government-to-government contacts have been limited to such technical subjects as air-traffic control, food safety and some police co-operation, for instance when one side seeks the return of a fleeing murderer. Chinese pressure is blamed for sharp declines in tourism from the mainland and in short-term exchanges by mainland students, though about 3,500 Chinese students remain in Taiwan on degree courses. Even scholars close to the DPP have been blacklisted from travel to China, among them Tseng Chien-yuan of Chung Hua University. He adds that Chinese academics he has known for decades are now barred from formal contacts with him. “I worry about this situation, because if the Chinese government only hears what it wants to know, they can never understand Taiwan,” says Mr Tseng.</p><p>China does hear from conservative supporters of the KMT, which backs closer ties with China, although not unification. About 370,000 mainlanders married to Taiwanese live on the island. Those who vote lean KMT. Equally, at any moment there are a million Taiwanese in China, including 400,000 long-term residents. Tales abound of Chinese officials offering economic rewards to Taiwanese businessmen who endorse unification.</p><p>Wang Ting-yu, a DPP legislator who sits on the parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committees, says that China’s intelligence services gather information about Taiwan from “between 10,000 and 100,000” agents and informers. Fewer than 5,000 are professional spies, he estimates. Chinese informers might be Taiwanese gangsters on the hustle in southern China, or Taiwanese businessmen looking for favours. Mr Wang cautions that China may not learn much from its spies. (Taiwan’s spooks are underwhelming when he asks about China, he notes, either because they do not trust parliamentarians or because “they don’t know anything”.)</p><p>A big danger is that ignorance leads to impatience. There are over 140 students from both sides of the straits at the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies at the University of Xiamen, a handsome port city with close geographic and cultural links to Taiwan. Chen Xiancai, a professor at the institute, says many arrive knowing little about the other side. Mainland students point to China’s strength and ask: “Why haven’t we unified yet?” His Taiwanese students retort: “Why are you in such a hurry?” The institute’s scholars stand out for their professionalism, visiting Taiwan often to conduct fieldwork. The professor leads a DPP study centre opened within the institute in 2017. But he is cautious about describing its work, saying it is focused on building a database of academic papers. Still, he is sometimes berated by online nationalists, who complain that the DPP should be “exterminated”, not studied.</p><p>Sherry Yu, a Taiwanese student in Xiamen, comes from a family that votes for the KMT. She wants a career in China but still laments that Chinese classmates—reared on jingoistic schoolbooks and censored news—cannot comprehend why Taiwanese would vote for the DPP or resist unification, insisting that they must simply want to humiliate China. Ms Yu thinks that Taiwanese just want to preserve their freedoms. When politics comes up, she often starts with “we”, then sadly finds herself using “you” and “me”.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687531'),(3,'https://www.economist.com/china/2018/07/05/a-deadline-looms-in-chinas-battle-with-foreign-firms-over-taiwan','The Economist',NULL,'A deadline looms in China’s battle with foreign firms over Taiwan','Most carriers will take the easy route and stop calling Taiwan a country',NULL,'','2018-07-05T14:57:17Z',1530802637000,'<p>WHEN it comes to asserting sovereignty over Taiwan, no fight is too small for Chinese officials. In January censors shut down the website of Marriott, a hotel chain, after it referred to Taiwan as well as Tibet, Hong Kong and Macau as countries in a customer survey. The site was unblocked only after the company’s chief executive issued a grovelling public apology. In April China complained about an online allusion to Taiwan as a country by organisers of the Man Booker prize for fiction (they eventually chose a fudge, listing the island instead as a “country/territory”). Gap, a fashion retailer, came under fire in May for selling a T-shirt with a map of China on it that did not include Taiwan. The firm responded by withdrawing the product and promising “rigorous reviews”.</p><p>China is still doing battle with international airlines. In April its civil aviation administration, CAAC, sent a letter to 44 of them, demanding that they specify Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as being parts of China when including them in drop-down menus of countries on booking websites. Fair enough for Hong Kong and Macau, which are universally recognised as being Chinese territories. But CAAC wants Taiwan to be called “Taiwan, China”, and maps to use the same colour for both the island and the People’s Republic. That is a problem. The island calls itself an independent, sovereign state.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Originally CAAC ordered the companies to comply by May 25th. However, by that date only 18 airlines had done so, despite the authority’s hint that violators would face punishment, including fines or action against their websites. Officials extended the deadline to July 25th, saying that some airlines were experiencing “technical difficulties” updating their lists. Among those that have fallen in line are Air Canada, Air France, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. Among the latest companies to do so is Air India, which this week began calling Taiwan “Chinese Taipei”, a term acceptable to China but viewed with disdain in Taiwan, which uses it only when access to international events requires it. Holdouts include the American carriers Delta, United and American Airlines, as well as a handful of Asian ones.</p><p>China’s spat with the airlines coincides with its stepped-up efforts to put pressure on the island itself. In the past year the Chinese armed forces have staged a growing number of exercises near Taiwan, including the flying of bombers and other aircraft around it. In May it deprived Taiwan of two members of its tiny band of diplomatic partners by establishing relations with Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic (China does not allow countries to have formal ties with Taiwan and China at the same time). Apart from wanting to signal displeasure with Taiwan, which has been led since 2016 by a party whose members scorn the idea of eventual reunification, China wants to warn America’s president, Donald Trump, that he should not get too friendly with the island.</p><p>Both America and Taiwan have bristled at China’s attempt to strong-arm the airlines. The White House called it “Orwellian nonsense”. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, says it represents “a new level of hysteria” in China’s approach to how others describe Taiwan. In theory, the island should have no objection to being called “Taiwan, China”. Its official name is the Republic of China and Taiwan is technically a province of that. But it worries that the word China is usually understood to mean the Communist-ruled entity that lays claim to Taiwan. “In essence, Taiwan is a country itself,” says Mr Wu. Informally, that is the name its officials give it.</p><p>China is digging in its heels. According to Reuters, it has refused an American government request for talks about the problem. Chinese leaders may be mindful of their image at home. In the cases involving Marriott, Gap and several of the airlines, it was Chinese netizens who sounded the alarm about the firms’ categorisations of Taiwan. Chinese social media blazed with rage as nationalists excoriated the companies. Under such pressure, the government had to take action, says Xin Qiang of Fudan University in Shanghai. Mr Xin says that, as Chinese officials see it, the risk of a domestic backlash for not acting toughly outweighs that of economic or diplomatic damage resulting from feuds with other countries. Most international airlines are likely to take the route of least resistance.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687404'),(4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/01/the-legalisation-of-gay-marriage-meets-resistance-in-taiwan','The Economist',NULL,'The legalisation of gay marriage meets resistance in Taiwan','Voters face a series of confusing referendums on the subject in late November',NULL,'','2018-11-01T16:40:21Z',1541090421000,'<p></p><p>NOWHERE IN ASIA celebrates gay pride as flamboyantly as Taipei. The annual parade in Taiwan’s capital draws tens of thousands, many from overseas. If you think near-naked men in diamanté tiaras and white go-go boots are normal for Asia—not to mention horned devils marching next to real Christian pastors—think again. Only in September did India legalise gay sex. In mainland China gay people are still often regarded as deviants. In Afghanistan sex between men is punishable by death.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Some 25 countries around the world allow same-sex marriage—but none of them is in Asia, unless you count Australia and New Zealand. Last year, however, Taipei’s parade-goers really had something to celebrate. Taiwan’s highest court had recently ruled that barring same-sex couples from marrying violated the right to be treated equally. It gave the government of President Tsai Ing-wen two years to write same-sex marriage into law.</p><p>At this year’s parade, on October 27th, the flamboyance could not conceal mounting worries. Since the court ruling, Ms Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have dithered over the needed legal changes. Ms Tsai was once outspoken in favour of marriage equality, which recommended her to younger voters. But she has since found the issue to be more polarising than she expected—and Taiwanese society has plenty of divisions already. Besides, municipal elections loom on November 24th. They will be a test of Ms Tsai’s leadership, and the DPP wants to avoid controversy. Its traditional base in the island’s south is older and more conservative, except in wanting Taiwan to declare a formal separation from China.</p><p>Anti-gay forces have seized their chance. A law passed by the DPP makes it easier to get referendums onto the ballot: voters face no fewer than ten questions on November 24th. One asks whether discussion of LGBT matters should be banned in primary and middle schools. It is intended to roll back those parts of the national curriculum that teach respect and understanding for gay students. The second asks whether voters think the civil code should define marriage as between a man and a woman. A third asks whether the rights of same-sex couples to form a permanent union should be guaranteed in a form other than civil marriage.</p><p>Gay activists have hit back with two referendums of their own—one asking whether the school curriculum should stipulate education on LGBT matters, and the other asking if same-sex rights should be enshrined in the civil code.</p><p>It is not clear how binding the results of the referendums are (they may also prove contradictory, which would be awkward). And the court has made clear that if the government does not legislate in time, same-sex couples may go ahead and marry anyway. But the conservatives’ aim is to change the climate, says Victoria Hsu of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights: teachers may grow nervous about talking about gay issues, for instance. Opponents of gay marriage would also like to get the government to institute a distinct form of marriage for gay couples, rather than amend existing marriage law. But for supporters of same-sex marriage, separate legislation for gays would be discriminatory. They liken it to America’s Jim Crow laws that once enforced racial segregation.</p><p>Other parts of Asia are watching Taiwan. Hong Kong has a vibrant civil society and growing openness to homosexuality. Since a court ruling in July the government recognises marriages of foreign same-sex couples conducted abroad for residency and other purposes. The move has the backing of businesses and law firms worried about Hong Kong’s ability to attract international talent. As in America, says Evan Wolfson, who has campaigned for marriage equality in several countries, it is likely to prove a step towards allowing same-sex couples from Hong Kong to marry.</p><p>After Hong Kong, Japan, the only G7 country that does not recognise same-sex unions, may be next. In September five foreign chambers of commerce called for marriage equality, backing calls from influential multinationals. One female lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party wrote this summer that LGBT couples were “unproductive” because they didn’t reproduce. But other ruling-party politicians are more open-minded. A growing number think the Olympic games, which Tokyo is hosting in 2020, could be a cue for Japan to come out in favour of marriage equality. That would put Japan itself on the podium.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687281'),(5,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/06/14/china-fights-taiwan-on-airline-websites','The Economist',NULL,'China fights Taiwan on airline websites','Meanwhile, America reinforces its alliance with Taiwan with bricks and mortar',NULL,'','2018-06-14T15:09:16Z',1528988956000,'<p>GIVEN all the hoopla of President Donald Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, the opening on the same day of a new American not-quite-an-embassy in Taipei was never going to hog the headlines. Yet to judge by how much Chinese officials have harangued American diplomats and congressmen about who was going to attend the ceremony in Taiwan’s capital, China appears to care every bit as much and perhaps more about America’s actions in Taiwan than about geopolitical rivalry on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>Since 1979, when America broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to open them with China, its “one-China policy” has been the bedrock of dealings with China. This means never referring to Taiwan as a country and always “acknowledging” that both China and Taiwan hold to the idea that there is but one China, even if the two sides disagree over the definition. The fudge has allowed America to enjoy close unofficial relations with Taiwan. China rarely appeared bothered by America’s unofficial representation in Taipei, known as the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). For a long time it was housed in a dingy former military building in an unprepossessing part of the city.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>The new building unveiled on June 12th, in contrast, is a design icon in the fancy district of Neihu. It cost $250m. It looks, smells and feels just like a formal embassy. Most of its nearly 500 staff are American diplomats, albeit on temporary leave from the State Department. It issues visas. The Trump administration has considered sending marines to guard it.</p><p>To China, which wants everyone to act as if Taiwan belongs to it, the new building is provocative. So, too, is a piece of legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act, passed unanimously by Congress and signed in March by Mr Trump, which encourages exchanges between American and Taiwanese officials. China has stressed that a high-level official at the opening would jeopardise talks on trade as well as co-operation over North Korea. China’s nightmare was the attendance of Mr Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton. He has called for America to “revisit” its one-China policy.</p><p>In the event, the administration kept the opening low-key, if only so as not to distract attention from the Singapore summit. The most senior American official present was Marie Royce, a mere assistant secretary of state (and also the spouse of a pro-Taiwan congressman). During the proceedings, America’s de facto ambassador, Kin Moy, bowed three times before a table laden with fruit and flowers and then lit incense. “I offer you this [building], a tangible symbol that the United States is here to stay,” Mr Moy told President Tsai Ing-wen and assembled guests. The AIT chairman, James Moriarty, described democratic Taiwan as a “model for the Indo-Pacific region” and promised continued American support for “Taiwan’s ability to defend itself”. Mr Trump has approved $1.4bn in arms sales.</p><p>China no doubt sees the building’s 99-year lease as yet another provocation. Xi Jinping, who recently awarded himself an unlimited lease on China’s presidency, insists that Taiwan’s return to the motherland cannot wait for ever. But whether China will pick a fight over Taiwan now is another matter. It is not clear that Mr Trump cares for the island, except as a pawn in trade negotiations with China. He is said to have criticised State Department speeches in support of Taiwan as complicating his dealings with Mr Xi. And he did not send Mr Bolton. Bonnie Glaser of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an American think-tank, reckons that China is getting less anxious.</p><p>Pressure only grows on Ms Tsai, however. China has put Taiwan in the doghouse since she came to office two years ago. Though she has gone out of her way not to antagonise, she will not acknowledge that Taiwan is part of China. And she has failed to condemn her prime minister, William Lai Ching-te, who has professed to be a “Taiwan independence worker”.</p><p>Official relations across the Taiwan Strait are frozen. China denies Taiwan a seat at international forums such as the World Health Organisation. It bullies international airlines and hotel groups into referring to the country as a mere region of China. In April it put on the biggest naval exercises ever carried out in the South China Sea, followed by live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait. Chinese bombers circle the island. Meanwhile, diplomatic allies peel off. In May the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso switched sides, leaving just 18 countries that recognise Taiwan.</p><p>And yet. The more China closes Taiwan’s diplomatic space, the more Ms Tsai’s creative use of unofficial diplomacy grows. Her “New Southbound Policy” attempts to forge deeper ties with South-East Asian neighbours and beyond, including those caught up in disputes with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea. (Taiwan also claims much of the sea, but is far less pushy about it.)</p><p>The scope of the policy is broad, ranging from promoting tourism to easing the plight of migrant workers to investing in manufacturing (Taiwan ranks well ahead of China in investment in Vietnam, for example). The emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region is bearing fruit. Merriden Varrall and Charlie Lyons Jones of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, say that Australia’s interest in the New Southbound Policy contrasts sharply with its wait-and-see approach to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Japan has signed a memorandum on search-and-rescue operations with Taiwan, bolstering its maritime security; intelligence-sharing may be formalised next. And Taiwanese officials are increasingly being invited to regional dialogues on the Indo-Pacific organised by think-tanks. Taiwan does not enjoy being chastised by China. But, as Ms Varrall and Mr Jones suggest, China also does not realise quite how counter-productive its approach is.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250687781'),(6,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/12/01/cheered-on-by-china-taiwans-opposition-drubs-the-ruling-party','The Economist',NULL,'Cheered on by China, Taiwan’s opposition drubs the ruling party','The president’s chances of re-election look dimmer',NULL,'','2018-11-29T15:46:55Z',1543506415000,'<p></p><p>ON THE FACE of things, local elections in Taiwan on November 24th had little to do with China. Rather, they centred on disgruntlement with Tsai Ing-wen, the president, who had pushed through several controversial reforms since taking office in 2016, while dithering over some of her supporters’ most cherished causes. But the outcome, a crushing defeat for Ms Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which would like Taiwan to abjure its notional status as part of China and declare itself a distinct country, will have prompted delight on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which favours ever-closer ties with China, has been revived after a dismal performance in 2016. Ms Tsai’s hopes of re-election in 2020 are looking dimmer.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p> Before the election the DPP controlled 13 of Taiwan’s 22 counties and cities. Now the tables have been turned. The KMT will run 15 and the DPP just six. (An independent candidate appears to have won re-election as mayor of Taipei, the capital.) The DPP even lost control of its electoral stronghold, the southern city of Kaohsiung, which it had ruled for 20 years. The results seemed so calamitous that Ms Tsai felt obliged to resign as head of the DPP. Her popular prime minister also offered to resign, but she demurred. “I’m the one that needs to change,” she declared on Facebook on November 26th.</p><p>Lo Chih-cheng, a DPP lawmaker, argues that Ms Tsai took on too many reforms at once. “The president was quite idealistic, not realistic,” Mr Lo said. “She thought the more, the better.” She cut unsustainable public pensions dramatically, which alienated many civil servants. She froze and in many cases confiscated the KMT’s assets, on the grounds that it had acquired them unfairly as the governing party during nearly 40 years of authoritarian rule. She pushed through a law to phase out nuclear power by 2025, alarming industrialists who rely on cheap and stable electricity.</p><p>Moreover, Mr Lo adds, when grappling with polarising issues, Ms Tsai has sometimes angered both sides in a fruitless search for middle ground. She limited normal working hours, upsetting bosses who now have to pay more overtime, but also trimmed the number of public holidays, angering ordinary workers. She dithered about legalising gay marriage, which she had supported during her election campaign, leaving it to the courts to settle the matter. And although she enraged China by refusing to affirm that it and Taiwan are both parts of the same country, she has been careful to do nothing else to provoke it, to the ire of independence activists.</p><p>The GDP growth rate has risen during Ms Tsai’s tenure, from 1.4% in 2016 to a projected 2.7% this year. But that has not been enough to dispel a sense of economic stagnation, compounded by the abrupt contraction of tourism from China following Ms Tsai’s election. Young Taiwanese continue to emigrate to the mainland in search of greater opportunity, often lured by generous official grants. Roughly a tenth of the Taiwanese workforce now lives in China.</p><p>China makes no bones about supporting the KMT. It cut all official contact with the national government after Ms Tsai’s election, but maintained links with KMT-run cities. During the campaign it halted intimidating circular patrols around the island by its warships and military aircraft, since such shows of force tend to stir nationalist feelings among Taiwanese, boosting the DPP. The Taiwanese government accused China of spreading false rumours on social media to help the KMT. Areas where the KMT has prevailed, such as Kaohsiung, are expected to see an influx of Chinese tourists and a surge in exports of agricultural goods to China.</p><p>But Mr Lo argues that it would be a mistake to view the results as endorsement of closer ties with China. There was a referendum on the ballot that touched directly on cross-strait relations, asking whether the country should demand to be called Taiwan at the Olympics, instead of Chinese Taipei. The result was ambiguous: the proposal was rejected, but only after the Olympic authorities warned that it might lead to Taiwan’s exclusion from the Tokyo games in 2020. The DPP did not campaign in favour of the idea, which is just the sort of departure from the status quo that Ms Tsai has tried to avoid.</p><p>Moreover, the KMT is still in disarray. Its candidate in Kaohsiung, Han Kuo-yu, proved to have genuine star power. But he is an outsider, initially written off by the leadership as a no-hoper. The party has no obvious presidential candidate.</p><p> Some in the DPP even see a silver lining in the nine other referendum questions on the ballot, none of which went the party’s way. Voters approved several measures hostile to gay rights, making it tricky for the government to fulfil the supreme court’s injunction to legalise gay marriage. They also rejected Ms Tsai’s scheme to close Taiwan’s nuclear plants. But it is the DPP that champions the idea of direct democracy. The Chinese authorities, who would love one day to absorb Taiwan, must hate the precedent being set.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250688031'),(7,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/04/05/taiwan-is-again-becoming-a-flashpoint-between-china-and-america','The Economist',NULL,'Taiwan is again becoming a flashpoint between China and America','Unlike tensions over trade and North Korea, it involves red lines on both sides',NULL,'','2018-04-05T14:51:07Z',1522939867000,'<p>IF THE partisanship of American politics unsettles you, take heart from a little piece of legislation that sailed through both houses of Congress with not a single vote opposed to it. And though the Taiwan Travel Act could have passed into law without a presidential signature, last month Donald Trump chose to put his cardiogrammatic scrawl to it. Given the chaos in Washington, the act reveals a remarkable consensus. It urges, though it does not mandate, high-level visits between America and Taiwan of the kind that successive administrations have discouraged, so as not to offend China.</p><p>That country’s “one-China principle” decrees that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese motherland. The Chinese government wants all other countries to act as if Taiwan belongs to it. America has never agreed to the formulation since breaking off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to establish them with China. It has made plain that Taiwan is a friend, to which it has long offered military support. But, in deference to China, American policy has never been to call Taiwan a separate country and always to “acknowledge” that both China and Taiwan agree on the principle that there is only one China, even if the two sides disagree over what exactly that means.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>This is America’s “one-China policy”. The convenient untruth, whose side-effect has been to deepen Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation, was formulated when dictatorships in both Beijing and Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, claimed to rule all of China. Taiwan has no such pretensions today. Many members of Congress have long wished to give the island more credit for its peaceful transformation into a flourishing democracy over the past three decades. The Taiwan Travel Act was born out of this. It even gets close to calling a spade a spade, and Taiwan a sovereign country: “Visits to a country by United States Cabinet members and other high-ranking officials are an indicator of the breadth and depth of ties between the United States and such country,” one clause reads. This week President Tsai Ing-wen welcomed the act’s congressional sponsors in Taipei.</p><p>More surprising is Mr Trump’s support. It is true that as president-elect in late 2016 he took a congratulatory telephone call from Ms Tsai. That set off palpitations among Washington’s China-watchers. Yet Mr Trump soon reaffirmed the one-China policy. He told a host on his favourite television channel that he would do nothing over Taiwan without first consulting the Chinese ruler, Xi Jinping. And the relationship he has subsequently developed with Mr Xi has been larded with admiration for the dictator’s power and style. Nothing Mr Trump has said or done suggests a remotely similar admiration for Taiwan.</p><p>Yet a shift of sorts is under way. In January one pro-Taiwan China hawk, Randall Schriver, was put in charge of Asia-Pacific policy at the Pentagon. A more prominent hawk, John Bolton, is about to become Mr Trump’s national security adviser. And in March Alex Wong, the official in charge of Indo-Pacific strategy at the State Department, was in Taipei to deliver a speech. Taiwan, he said, “can no longer be excluded unjustly from international fora. [It] has much to share with the world.” With Taiwan barred from everything from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to Interpol, Mr Wong has a point. He assured Ms Tsai that American support for Taiwan has never been stronger.</p><p>China is not amused, although its increased diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan since Ms Tsai’s election two years ago has surely helped galvanise the American stance. Dignitaries visiting Beijing have been told that the sort of exchanges the travel act encourages could cross a red line, and that it is therefore more dangerous than two other big challenges facing Mr Xi. The first is the delicate summitry around a nuclear North Korea. The second is the growing American assault on Chinese exports and China-first industrial policies—on April 3rd the Trump administration announced 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods, from locomotives to snowblowers (see article).</p><p>The number two at the Chinese embassy in Washington, Li Kexin, warned Mr Trump not to sign the travel act. Last year he tried bullying Congress into watering down the National Defence Authorisation Act, which empowers (but again does not require) American naval vessels to call at Taiwanese ports. “The day that a US navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People’s Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force,” he thundered at a reception in December. Last month Mr Xi himself warned that any actions to “split China” would face “the punishment of history”. Such threats are having some effect in Taiwan. Even Ms Tsai’s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party is split over how much support to give the travel act. Ms Tsai herself is instinctively cautious about upsetting China. Few Taiwanese want their country to be a pawn in a great-power game.</p><p>A test comes in the summer, when America opens a gleaming building in Taipei to house its unofficial embassy, with rumours that a member of the cabinet may attend. Mr Bolton’s presence might genuinely alarm China. Alternatively, it might interpret the Trump administration’s steps over Taiwan as a mere prop to pressure on trade. Mr Xi’s top economics official, Liu He, is in intense negotiations over China’s gaping trade surplus with America. He is presumed to have Mr Xi’s authority to offer to cut the surplus by tens of billions of dollars to avert a fully fledged trade war.</p><p>But what if China sees America as continuing to change the status quo on Taiwan after that? A few years ago Mr Xi said that the Taiwan “problem” cannot be left to future generations. Now that he has seized all the levers of power, nationalists would judge him harshly if he did not use them to stop Taiwan slipping away. So the island is shooting up the security agenda again—a reminder of the flashpoint it does not want to be, but still is.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250688394'),(8,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/05/26/taiwans-president-has-upset-both-business-and-workers','The Economist',NULL,'Taiwan’s president has upset both business and workers','When growth is slow, it is hard for Tsai Ing-wen to please anyone',NULL,'','2018-05-26T00:00:00Z',1527292800000,'<p>LIKE a nervous candidate in a job interview, shy yet formal, she fielded questions ranging from how to handle Chinese infiltration to why she always wears trouser suits. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s usually plain-speaking president, marked her second anniversary in office with a rare live interview with a critical website.</p><p>Ms Tsai badly needs to restate her case to the people. In two years her approval ratings have slumped from almost 70% to as low as 26%, according to a broadcaster, TVBS; the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation says 48% of her compatriots disapprove of her performance, against 39% in favour. She has lost ground especially with the young, whom she has eagerly courted.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Elected in a landslide in 2016, Ms Tsai blazed a trail as the first female leader of a Chinese-speaking country in modern times. Her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also won a majority in Taiwan’s parliament for the first time, finally ending the grip of the Kuomintang (KMT) that began when Chiang Kai-shek and his forces fled to Taiwan from mainland China in 1949.</p><p>But her promise to revive the island’s economy, which used to be tigerish but has grown sluggish, remains unfulfilled. At the same time, tension with China has grown, despite Ms Tsai’s efforts to restrain the more radical wing of the DPP, which wants to declare formal independence, rather than maintain the current fiction that the government of Taiwan notionally represents the whole of China. Such a step, China has said, would be grounds for war.</p><p>Ms Tsai has tried to appeal both to business, in the hope of stimulating the economy, and to workers and environmentalists, the bedrock of the centre-left DPP. She has ended up pleasing neither. The DPP has promised to phase out nuclear power, but Ms Tsai allowed two shuttered reactors to restart after a big blackout last year, to the dismay of greens who object to nuclear energy despite its minimal greenhouse-gas emissions. In the name of workers’ rights, she issued new rules on working hours, which companies denounced as unduly rigid. When she modified them somewhat, unions howled.</p><p>Wages are barely higher than 15 years ago (see chart), largely because of increasing competition from manufacturers in China and elsewhere, which has left Taiwanese employers with little leeway to increase salaries. Many frustrated young university graduates have left the country in search of better opportunities. Ms Tsai has raised the monthly minimum wage by 10%, to NT$22,000 ($733). This year she also increased civil servants’ pay by 3%. Yet on May 1st thousands of workers took to the streets, waving banners reading “Fight for a higher salary”.</p><p>Taiwan has one of the lowest levels of foreign investment in Asia, points out William Foreman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. Ms Tsai’s government has given tax breaks to angel investors. She has also tried to pare regulation, giving firms more leeway to experiment with financial services, for example. And she has identified five industries in which she thinks Taiwanese firms can compete internationally: defence, biotechnology, clean energy, the internet of things and smart machinery—although only the last of these, notes Stephen Su of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, is currently a significant earner for local businesses.</p><p>Economic growth has picked up, from 1% year-on-year in the quarter in which Ms Tsai took office to 3% in the first quarter of this year. But workers are not feeling the benefit. Other reforms, however, have bitten. The government’s (much needed) cuts to pensions for civil servants and teachers prompted big demonstrations. Last month hundreds of veterans scuffled with police and threw smoke-bombs to protest against plans to cut military pensions too.</p><p>On social issues Ms Tsai has wobbled. Before she was elected she put out a video supporting gay marriage. But once in power, the DPP backed away and dithered. In the end it was the constitutional court that ruled in favour of gay marriage a year ago, instructing parliament to enact the necessary laws. It has not yet done so. That has left young people disillusioned, says Jason Hsu, a KMT lawmaker, who believes gay marriage was one of the main reasons Ms Tsai captured the youth vote.</p><p>Ms Tsai also promised to provide a proper accounting of the human-rights abuses committed during the KMT’s long, harsh dictatorship, and to remove all monuments glorifying this era. But she has appointed a former member of a watchdog agency under the previous KMT administration to head the committee in charge of this project. This has upset some in her own party. Meanwhile, a law that strips the KMT of wealth deemed ill-gotten has infuriated the opposition.</p><p>The KMT is still reeling from its defeat in 2016 and the legislative setbacks that followed. Its leadership is weak. But Ms Tsai faces opposition of a different sort. Two ex-presidents (one from the DPP and one from the KMT) and many prominent politicians, especially within the DPP, want her to permit a referendum on independence—something that would provoke a dire response from China. She is resisting, while counting on an economic upturn to bolster her fortunes. “We’ve spent most of my first two years in preparation, including legal preparation, so in my presidency’s next two years we will speed up the pace of implementation,” she said in her online interview. But time flies.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250688486'),(9,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/01/26/chinas-might-is-forcing-taiwan-to-rethink-its-military-strategy','The Economist',NULL,'China’s might is forcing Taiwan to rethink its military strategy','It wants to become an indigestible “porcupine”',NULL,'','2019-01-26T00:00:00Z',1548460800000,'<p></p><p>TAIWAN “MUST and will” be reunited with the mainland, declared Xi Jinping, China’s president, on January 2nd. Chinese leaders have been saying such things since the retreating Nationalists separated the island from the rest of the country after losing the civil war to the Communists in 1949. But Mr Xi has done more than just talk: he has sent bombers and warships to circle the island, held live-fire drills in the narrow Taiwan Strait and, Taiwanese generals say, instructed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to be capable of seizing Taiwan by force by next year. Back in 1996, the most recent cross-strait crisis, China’s military spending was barely twice Taiwan’s. Now it is 15 times greater. That has left Taiwanese leaders rushing to rethink their defences.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Taiwan already does a great deal to make itself indigestible to invaders. The island is “honeycombed with bunkers”, says Ian Easton of the Project 2049 Institute, an American think-tank. Tanks are hidden away in bustling neighbourhoods of Taipei. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Highway Number One was built to handle not only rush-hour traffic, but also ten-tonne fighter jets, since the island’s airfields would quickly be destroyed by Chinese missiles should war break out.</p><p>America, Taiwan’s closest military ally, has urged the island to move further towards a “porcupine strategy”. It wants Taiwan to acquire smaller, cheaper and more mobile weapons that could wear down Chinese forces close to Taiwan’s shores, in the place of big, lumbering and expensive kit such as warplanes and battleships, which are better suited to projecting firepower onto China’s mainland.</p><p>Taiwanese planners have taken note. In 2017 the country’s top military officer launched the “Overall Defence Concept”. That strategy, endorsed by Tsai Ing-wen, the president, embraces the porcupine ethos. One priority is intelligent sea mines, which can scoot around and so evade sweeping. Some are more advanced than anything in America’s arsenal. Another focus is unmanned platforms, such as remote-controlled sentry guns to guard outlying islands and armed drones to patrol the coastline. Third is an emphasis on missiles. Taiwan is churning out Hsiung Feng cruise missiles by the hundreds. These can be placed not only on small, zippy speedboats rather than bulky destroyers, but also in unmarked lorries. Such rocket-laden vehicles are hidden “in places you cannot imagine”, says one official, and could continue to operate from anywhere on the road network long after invaders had obliterated Taiwan’s fighter jets. Better yet, they are far cheaper than warplanes.</p><p>Yet not everyone is willing to jettison traditional ways of war. The new defence policy appeals to the president and her staff not only for its military virtues, but also because it favours the smaller systems that Taiwan can build itself. But the top brass has reasons beyond vanity to defend their shiny objects.</p><p>They concede that heavy tanks, big ships and fancy warplanes may not survive a head-to-head conflict with China. But they act as a deterrent and boost morale. Missiles cannot fend off prowling Chinese bombers nor speedboats patrol stormy oceans. “Parades are a form of deterrence, certainly in Asia,” notes Drew Thompson, who used to help shape policy on Taiwan at America’s Department of Defence. “Big-ticket items parade well.”</p><p>They also let Taiwan take the fight to China. Taiwan’s American-made frigates would eventually be blown out of the water, but not before their potent torpedoes might inflict serious damage on Chinese ships. That would not only boost the morale of islanders facing a hailstorm of missiles, it might also induce caution in Mr Xi.</p><p>The problem is that showcase weapons are expensive. Even domestically built submarines—Taiwan hopes to make eight—cost more than $1bn apiece; the entire annual defence budget is just $11bn. Money is even tighter because Taiwan is scrapping conscription and shifting to an all-volunteer force. And since salaried soldiers are pricier, their numbers are fewer. Taiwan’s armed forces have shed more than 150,000 people since China’s cross-strait muscle-flexing in 1996, leaving 215,000. The country’s reserve force, its second line of defence, will also shrink with every passing year. Even so, any return to compulsory enlistment would be electoral suicide, politicians say.</p><p>American arms, even big, expensive ones at odds with the porcupine philosophy, also serve a diplomatic purpose. America’s involvement in a war could be the difference between Taiwan’s survival and extinction. Just eight American submarines could sink 40% of China’s amphibious fleet in the first week of fighting, according to computer simulations by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank.</p><p>Although America does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it maintains close ties. Some 3,500-4,000 Pentagon officials travel to Taiwan every year, an average of more than ten per day. Arms sales have totalled more than $15bn since 2010. The relationship is deepening in some respects. Arms transfers were previously bundled into big packages that reliably aroused Chinese anger; they are now growing more routine.</p><p>The administration of Donald Trump is stacked with senior officials who know Taiwan well and sympathise with its plight. Mr Trump delighted Taiwan’s leaders by holding a taboo-busting phone call with Ms Tsai when he was president-elect. Last year he also signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages senior American officials to visit the island and vice versa. If arms sales help bolster America’s commitment to Taiwan, so much the better.</p><p>Though Mr Xi clearly feels obliged to continue to hound Taiwan about reunification, he has thus far avoided laying down a firm timeline. The relatively slow growth of China’s amphibious fleet casts doubt on the idea that the PLA is working flat out to be ready to invade. Nor has it been conducting big amphibious exercises. There is still time for Taiwan to sharpen its quills.</p><p>Correction (January 24th 2019): The original version of this article said that an average of more than 100 Pentagon officials travelled to Taiwan each day.

They made data from the Accounting and Statistics Office accessible, easy to understand and interactive. The public could rate and comment on every item in the budget. This became the foundation of the gØv (“gov-zero”) movement, which is now one of the world’s most active civic-tech communities.</p><p>Since then, Taiwan has put online collaboration at the core of its governance. The idea is to bring technology into the spaces where citizens live, rather than expect citizens to enter the space of technology. The premise is this: the government must first trust the people with agenda-setting power; then the people can make democracy work.</p><p>Taiwan did not always enjoy these freedoms, digital or otherwise. In 1987 martial law was lifted after nearly 40 years. The first direct presidential election took place in 1996, just as the internet was taking off. By then, Taiwan had a fairly robust civil society, built on an historic practice of community associations that used “collaborative action” to find common solutions.</p><p>The island of Taiwan is about 400km (250 miles) long, a journey of less than two hours by high-speed rail. This has proved a major advantage in deploying internet connectivity. The idea of broadband as a human right is at the core of the government’s policy. Some 87% of people over the age of 12 are connected. For a population of 23m, the internet is even more natural as a public space for discussion than the practice of voting.</p><p>Today, generations accustomed to authoritarian power and generations accustomed to freedom coexist, and occasionally clash. Yet a common thread running through our digital democracy projects is collaborative participation.</p><p>Taiwan’s national platform for online participation, called “Join”, and the Taipei City government have adopted the gØv system for projects to include the public in budget matters. Data visualisation tools help people to understand what is allocated where. The “Join” platform, with over 4m participants, extends beyond budget matters. Anyone can begin an e-petition on the platform. Once a case has 5,000 signatures, the relevant ministries must respond in public.</p><p>As Digital Minister, I have established a network of Participation Officers in each ministry. They serve as the links between the general public and the public sectors, and as channels for inter-agency collaboration. Whenever a proposal is raised, a collaborative meeting can be held, with participants from government departments and the public invited to join the discussion and to jointly create new policies.</p><p>So far we have held more than 40 collaborative meetings. We gathered stakeholders to find solutions, be it to improve the experience of filing income tax, the allocation of medical resources in remote towns, or balancing the fishery and marine biodiversity in national parks.</p><p>The adoption of civic innovations in the public sector requires an established system for regulation, maintenance and accountability. Thus, it is imperative that the government, the tech community and companies come together to form a collaborative ecosystem to amplify the impact of civic technology: code can support democratic values in a way that wasn’t previously possible.</p><p>It is only through integrating with the existing legal system, with the backing of laws and regulations, that social innovation can drive regulatory innovation. For example, we launched a Regulatory Sandbox platform in 2017, allowing entrepreneurs to experiment freely without legal constraints for a certain period of time. It is meant to spur fintech experiments and autonomous vehicles, among other innovations.</p><p>Another important driver for public participation in law-making is the vTaiwan platform, which was initiated by the gØv community. (Where the Join platform is run and maintained by the government, vTaiwan is run by citizens and maintained by gØv.) The legal status of Uber was heatedly discussed on vTaiwan, supported by a system using artificial intelligence to manage the conversation. This helped the different sides converge towards a “Diversified Taxi Services Plan” in 2016. In 2018 vTaiwan also successfully helped enact regulations for the platform economy.</p><p>In addition to lowering the barriers to democracy, this approach is also a process of mutual understanding. When the public sees the results of collaboration, it leads to more participation. Only through this cycle will it be possible for citizens to provide concrete feedback and go even further by applying, adjusting and contributing to the civic tech community.</p><p>Our goals for PDIS, the policy lab in Taiwan’s cabinet, is to bring these experimental results to people all over the world. We have visited New York, Toronto, Madrid, Tokyo and Hong Kong to co-organise workshops with civic tech communities for sharing democratic innovations, such as our Participation Officers network and collaborative meetings. The gØv programme has been transplanted internationally, with “gØv Italy” set up in 2018.</p><p>International co-operation is no longer just about agreements between governments: it is also about people building shared values. For example, at our Presidential Hackathon last year, the cross-sectoral team “Water Saviours” deployed machine learning to assist pipe repair with an accuracy rate of 70%.

To me, democracy’s future is based on a culture of listening. Taiwan has no “legacy systems” of representative democracy (to use the language of technology) and the internet is highly developed.

Now, democracy is a conversation between many diverse values.”</p><p>At a time when the world is rethinking basic elements of governance, Taiwan’s digital democracy—in which the people take the initiative, and the government responds in the here and now—can serve as a demonstration of new forms of citizen and state co-operation and dialogue for the 21st century.</p><p>_________</p><p>Audrey Tang is the Digital Minister of Taiwan and the first openly transgender government minister in the world.</p><p>Author photo credit: Camille McOuat (CC BY 4.0)</p><p>Also in this series:Matthew Taylor: Citizen deliberation is the gateway to a better politicsCass Sunstein: Political savagery makes self-government impossible</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555250688192'),(12,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/03/21/tsai-ing-wen-taiwans-president-is-challenged-by-a-former-underling','The Economist',NULL,'Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, is challenged by a former underling','No incumbent seeking re-election has had to fight a primary before',NULL,'','2019-03-21T15:41:11Z',1553182871000,'<p>AS TAIWAN’S FIRST female president, Tsai Ing-wen is a trailblazer. She is well-liked abroad for her reluctance to pick fights with China. But she is not popular at home. Recent polls put her approval rating below 30%. Her bid for re-election next year, already iffy, just got iffier. Lai Ching-te, her former prime minister, has declared that he will challenge Ms Tsai for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). It is the first time an incumbent president in Taiwan has been subjected to a primary. And the contest may anger China, since Mr Lai is a more vocal supporter than Ms Tsai of the idea that Taiwan should formally declare itself to be a distinct country from China—a move China says would be grounds for war.  </p><p>“Taiwan doesn’t want to be a second Hong Kong or Tibet,” declared Mr Lai as he registered for the primary this week, insinuating that Ms Tsai is not doing enough to ensure Taiwan’s independence. The DPP was thrashed in municipal elections in November by the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, which advocates warmer relations with China. Voters seemed disappointed that Ms Tsai’s efforts to stimulate the economy have had scant success. Growth is slowing. Wages have been stagnant for decades.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Following the defeat in November, Ms Tsai stepped down as leader of the DPP. A month later Mr Lai, a former mayor of the southern city of Tainan, resigned as prime minister, spurning Ms Tsai’s entreaties for him to stay. The primary will involve the two candidates giving televised presentations of their platforms, after which the party conducts an opinion poll of a sample of the whole electorate. The more popular candidate wins the nomination. The results will be announced on April 17th.</p><p>DPP activists had been panicking, as Ms Tsai has been trailing badly in the polls. They feared not only a further electoral setback, but one that would have put the government into the hands of a China-friendly leader just as China is pressing Taiwan to begin talks on unification. Some advocates of independence, fed up with Ms Tsai’s caution, are jubilant at Mr Lai’s announcement, both because they think Mr Lai has a better chance of winning and because they think he might be more assertive.</p><p>Ms Tsai’s supporters, meanwhile, are arguing that the primary could split the party and are making agonised calls for unity, by which they seem to mean Mr Lai’s withdrawal. Chen Chi-mai, the deputy prime minister and a supporter of Ms Tsai, argued in a Facebook post that China’s growing assertiveness makes divisions within the party especially dangerous. “The 2020 election will determine whether Taiwan survives or is extinguished,” he said. </p><p>Luckily for the DPP, the KMT also has no anointed candidate and its primary is still some months away. A former mayor of New Taipei City, Eric Chu, and a former speaker of parliament, Wang Jin-pyng, have both said they will run. The election will probably also feature an independent candidate, Ko Wen-je, the popular mayor of Taipei.  </p><p> Inevitably, China will be front and centre in the campaign. The authorities across the Taiwan Strait probably revile Mr Lai even more than they do Ms Tsai. That might encourage them to ease the pressure on Taiwan a bit over the next few months. The Chinese government knows from experience that attempts to intimidate Taiwanese voters tend to backfire, prompting them to back the candidate most hostile to its cherished goal of reunification.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/economist/1555377243903'),(13,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/29/cheered-on-by-china-taiwans-opposition-drubs-the-ruling-party','The Economist',NULL,'Cheered on by China, Taiwan’s opposition drubs the ruling party','The president’s chances of re-election look dimmer',NULL,'','2018-11-29T15:46:55Z',1543506415000,'<p></p><p>ON THE FACE of things, local elections in Taiwan on November 24th had little to do with China. Rather, they centred on disgruntlement with Tsai Ing-wen, the president, who had pushed through several controversial reforms since taking office in 2016, while dithering over some of her supporters’ most cherished causes. But the outcome, a crushing defeat for Ms Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which would like Taiwan to abjure its notional status as part of China and declare itself a distinct country, will have prompted delight on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which favours ever-closer ties with China, has been revived after a dismal performance in 2016. Ms Tsai’s hopes of re-election in 2020 are looking dimmer.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p> Before the election the DPP controlled 13 of Taiwan’s 22 counties and cities. Now the tables have been turned. The KMT will run 15 and the DPP just six. (An independent candidate appears to have won re-election as mayor of Taipei, the capital.) The DPP even lost control of its electoral stronghold, the southern city of Kaohsiung, which it had ruled for 20 years. The results seemed so calamitous that Ms Tsai felt obliged to resign as head of the DPP. Her popular prime minister also offered to resign, but she demurred. “I’m the one that needs to change,” she declared on Facebook on November 26th.</p><p>Lo Chih-cheng, a DPP lawmaker, argues that Ms Tsai took on too many reforms at once. “The president was quite idealistic, not realistic,” Mr Lo said. “She thought the more, the better.” She cut unsustainable public pensions dramatically, which alienated many civil servants. She froze and in many cases confiscated the KMT’s assets, on the grounds that it had acquired them unfairly as the governing party during nearly 40 years of authoritarian rule. She pushed through a law to phase out nuclear power by 2025, alarming industrialists who rely on cheap and stable electricity.</p><p>Moreover, Mr Lo adds, when grappling with polarising issues, Ms Tsai has sometimes angered both sides in a fruitless search for middle ground. She limited normal working hours, upsetting bosses who now have to pay more overtime, but also trimmed the number of public holidays, angering ordinary workers. She dithered about legalising gay marriage, which she had supported during her election campaign, leaving it to the courts to settle the matter. And although she enraged China by refusing to affirm that it and Taiwan are both parts of the same country, she has been careful to do nothing else to provoke it, to the ire of independence activists.</p><p>The GDP growth rate has risen during Ms Tsai’s tenure, from 1.4% in 2016 to a projected 2.7% this year. But that has not been enough to dispel a sense of economic stagnation, compounded by the abrupt contraction of tourism from China following Ms Tsai’s election. Young Taiwanese continue to emigrate to the mainland in search of greater opportunity, often lured by generous official grants. Roughly a tenth of the Taiwanese workforce now lives in China.</p><p>China makes no bones about supporting the KMT. It cut all official contact with the national government after Ms Tsai’s election, but maintained links with KMT-run cities. During the campaign it halted intimidating circular patrols around the island by its warships and military aircraft, since such shows of force tend to stir nationalist feelings among Taiwanese, boosting the DPP. The Taiwanese government accused China of spreading false rumours on social media to help the KMT. Areas where the KMT has prevailed, such as Kaohsiung, are expected to see an influx of Chinese tourists and a surge in exports of agricultural goods to China.</p><p>But Mr Lo argues that it would be a mistake to view the results as endorsement of closer ties with China. There was a referendum on the ballot that touched directly on cross-strait relations, asking whether the country should demand to be called Taiwan at the Olympics, instead of Chinese Taipei. The result was ambiguous: the proposal was rejected, but only after the Olympic authorities warned that it might lead to Taiwan’s exclusion from the Tokyo games in 2020. The DPP did not campaign in favour of the idea, which is just the sort of departure from the status quo that Ms Tsai has tried to avoid.</p><p>Moreover, the KMT is still in disarray. Its candidate in Kaohsiung, Han Kuo-yu, proved to have genuine star power. But he is an outsider, initially written off by the leadership as a no-hoper. The party has no obvious presidential candidate.</p><p> Some in the DPP even see a silver lining in the nine other referendum questions on the ballot, none of which went the party’s way. Voters approved several measures hostile to gay rights, making it tricky for the government to fulfil the supreme court’s injunction to legalise gay marriage. They also rejected Ms Tsai’s scheme to close Taiwan’s nuclear plants. But it is the DPP that champions the idea of direct democracy. The Chinese authorities, who would love one day to absorb Taiwan, must hate the precedent being set.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20181201_ASP005_0.jpg');

As the UK Taiwan film festival kicks off, he talks about his latest work – about a man with neck pain who owns a fish\n',NULL,'','2019-04-04T14:09:56+0100',1554383396000,'<p>‘In my childhood, cinema was like going into a temple. Now, it’s more like going into a shopping mall,” says Tsai Ming-liang. Over the course of his nearly 30-year career, the Taiwanese film-maker’s work has moved further and further towards the “temple” end of the spectrum. Often bracketed under the “slow cinema” movement, he is a master of the very long take. His last feature, 2013’s Stray Dogs, included a shot of two people staring at a mural in an abandoned building that lasted over 14 minutes. But despite his shaven head, Tsai is no monk. In the past, his films have featured choreographed musical sequences, surreal comedy, and plenty of sex – gay, straight, solo, even watermelon-incorporating, in the case of 2005’s The Wayward Cloud.</p><p>In person, he is unassuming and quick to laugh. “In the past I really cared if people understood my films, but when you grow older, you care less,” says Tsai, who turned 61 last year. “You want to do something to please yourself. I feel like the film industry has trapped film-makers. They tell you you need to have a narrative structure, you need to do things a certain way. They limit the imaginations of film-makers. I often think about, what is the meaning of film? What does film want to say? The simple thing is, film is about images.”</p><p>After Stray Dogs, which won a host of international awards, Tsai claimed he was giving up commercial cinema altogether, but few could have anticipated where he would go next: virtual reality. The Deserted is possibly Tsai’s most contemplative work yet. Free of dialogue and narrative, it is set in a derelict, overgrown apartment block in the Taiwanese countryside, occupied by a man with neck pains, and what could be the ghosts of his mother and wife, and a large, white pet fish. The viewer becomes an invisible spectator to this surreal domestic tableau. The action is unhurried but never dull to look at, and you can always swivel round on your chair to appreciate the stained concrete walls, the puddles on the floor and the lush greenery outside the pane-less windows.</p><p>Tsai is one of the most consistent auteurs cinema has ever known, and aficionados will recognise many of his trademarks in The Deserted: the man is Tsai’s regular actor Lee Kang-sheng – whom he first cast in 1991, and has not made a film without since; derelict buildings and water also frequently feature in his work. Ghosts, too: in Goodbye, Dragon Inn, the living and the dead communed in a condemned Taipei cinema (screening King Hu’s 1967 martial arts classic Dragon Inn). Lee’s neck pain was also a theme in 1997’s The River. The white fish was also seen in 2001’s What Time Is It There? when the mother believed it to be the reincarnated spirit of her dead husband. The Deserted is a film full of ghosts, and thanks to virtual reality, the viewer becomes another one.</p><p>“I’m a Buddhist,” says Tsai. “When I enter a new space, especially ruins or an abandoned place, I often say hello and have a little chat. I always feel there is someone there, a fairy, ghost or spirit.” The Mandarin title of The Deserted translates as The Home at Lan Re Temple, Tsai explains, which comes from a Chinese ghost story. “The Lan Re temple in Buddhism is actually a space for all the spirits to gather around. This is their space.” The Deserted was shot next door to the abandoned building where Tsai and Lee moved five years ago, to get back to nature and help Lee’s recovery after a stroke and a mystery recurring illness (the neck pain is real). Another recent film, Afternoon, also shot in an abandoned building nearby, is a conversation between the two men, about their long relationship, personal and professional.</p><p>“Through film-making, I have discovered the concept of time,” Tsai says. Having worked with the same subjects and casts for decades, his films have become a way of capturing the ghosts of the past and tracking time’s passage, whether in the face of Lee or the landscapes of rapidly developing Taiwan.</p><p>Tsai, born in Malaysia, came to Taiwan as a student in 1985 when the country was still under martial law. That ended two years later, and Tsai became part of a new wave of renowned Taiwanese film-makers, including Ang Lee, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang. They didn’t just benefit from Taiwan’s liberalisation, they helped make it happen, Tsai explains. “Me and many other film-makers were fighting the system, trying to make it more open. If you look at Asia now, Taiwan is the most open-minded and welcoming to all ways of film-making.”</p><p>Tsai never stopped making films after Stray Dogs, he says; he just found other ways to do it, and different places to show them. Where his contemporaries have struggled to compete with Hollywood and Chinese blockbusters in the “shopping mall”, Tsai has turned to museums and art galleries to show his work. “Many people tell me I should have disappeared a long time ago,” he laughs. But instead, to his surprise, he has found new viewers. “In Asia right now, my audiences are more people in their teens and 20s than people of my generation,” he says. “Maybe it’s because they are the internet generation, they see so much information every day. So when they experience my films they maybe feel something different. They have no baggage about ‘what is film?’”</p><p>As well as honouring cinema’s past, perhaps Tsai’s meditative works points the way to its future.</p><p>• A retrospective of Tsai Ming-Liang’s films, curated by the director himself, and including the UK premiere of The Deserted (4-8 April), is part of of the UK Taiwan film festival, from 3-14 April.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(2,'https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/27/taiwanese-game-removed-from-sale-after-anti-china-messages-discovered','The Guardian',NULL,'\nTaiwanese game removed from sale after anti-China messages discovered\n','\n\nMentions of game including hidden message comparing Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh also scrubbed from social media site Weibo\n',NULL,'\nPatrick Lum','2019-02-27T12:56:47+0000',1551272207000,'<p>Taiwanese horror game Devotion has been removed from sale globally, following a backlash after a hidden message referencing Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie-the-Pooh was discovered in-game.</p><p>Devotion, by the Taiwanese indie developer Red Candle Games, was released on 19 February and was initially popular among horror enthusiasts.

It is unclear if this is a government direction or pre-emptive self-censorship.</p><p>Devotion and Red Candle’s previous game, Detention, have also received a slew of negative reviews by users – possibly targets of a review-bombing campaign. Many reviews reference other alleged inferences that are derogatory towards Chinese people, such as a cult leader named Lu Gongmin, a homophone for “mainland citizen”, in a related marketing campaign.</p><p>The developer has apologised on 23 February and removed the politically sensitive materials in an updated version of Devotion, explaining that prototype materials containing internet memes were unintentionally not removed before launch.</p><p>“This is purely an accident, and we have no intention for causing harm nor hatred,” the apology reads. “Red Candle Games take full responsibility…”</p><p>The game’s Chinese partners, Indievent and Winking Entertainment, have severed relations with the developer.</p><p>On 23 February, Chen Chi-mai, Taiwan’s vice premier, praised the game in a Facebook post, saying “only in countries with democracy and freedom can creation be free from restrictions”.</p><p>Taiwanese pro-independence sentiment remains controversial in China. Last year, film director Fu Yue was censored in China after mentioning Taiwanese independence in an acceptance speech at the Taipei Golden Horse awards, a festival and awards programme founded by the Taiwanese government. Chinese gamers are concerned about the possibility of tighter censorship on Steam, and other popular games such as Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, which are technically available in the PRC but have not been approved by government regulators and could be banned at any time.

Justices told legislators then to make same-sex marriage legal within two years, a first for Asia, where religion and conservative governments normally keep the bans in place.Although the ballot is advisory only, it is expected to frustrate lawmakers mindful of public opinion as they face the court deadline next year. Many legislators will stand for re-election in 2020.“The legislature has lots of choices on how to make this court order take effect,” said referendum proponent Chen Ke, a Catholic pastor in Taiwan and an opponent of same-sex marriage.Ruling party lawmakers backed by president Tsai Ing-wen had proposed legalising same-sex marriage in late 2016, but put aside their ideas to await the court hearing. Opposition to same-sex marriage crested after the court ruling. Opponents have held rallies and mobilised votes online.Courts will still consider local marriage-licensing offices in violation of the law if they refuse same-sex couples until May 2019, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said last week.“The referendum is a general survey, it doesn’t have very strong legal implications,” said Shiau Hong-chi, a professor of gender studies and communications management at Shih-Hsin University in Taiwan. “One way or another it has to go back to the court.”Voters approved a separate measure on Saturday calling for a “different process” to protect same-sex unions. It is viewed as an alternative to using the civil code. A third initiative, also approved, asked that schools avoid teaching LGBT “education”.Amnesty International told the government it needed to “deliver equality and dignity”.“This result is a bitter blow and a step backwards for human rights in Taiwan,” Amnesty’s Taiwan-based acting director, Annie Huang, said. “However, despite this setback, we remain confident that love and equality will ultimately prevail.”Taiwanese also elected candidates from the China-friendly opposition Nationalist party to a majority of mayoral and county magistrate posts, reversing the party’s losses in 2014.</p><p>China welcomed the defeat of Taiwan’s pro-independence ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) at the local elections, saying it showed people wanted peaceful relations with Beijing.</p><p>The vote dealt a major blow to President Tsai Ing-wen’s hopes of re-election in 2020, forcing her to quit as DPP leader as the Beijing-friendly main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) made gains in the face of China’s increasing pressure on the island.</p><p>The DPP has been left in control of only six of Taiwan’s cities and counties, compared with at least 15 for the KMT. The losses included one of its most steadfast strongholds, the southern city of Kaohsiung.</p><p>“The [election] results reflected the strong will of the Taiwan public in hoping to continue to share the benefits of the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, and their strong wish in hoping to improve the island’s economy and people’s wellbeing,” said a statement by China’s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office and carried by state media.</p><p>Tsai and the DPP have faced a mounting backlash over domestic reforms as well as concerns about deteriorating ties with China, which still sees self-ruling Taiwan as part of its territory to be reunified.</p><p>Tsai told reporters that she would take “complete responsibility” for the defeat as she resigned as chair of the party.</p><p>Beijing has intensified pressure on Taiwan under Tsai, upping military drills, poaching diplomatic allies and successfully convincing international businesses to list the island as part of China on their websites.</p><p>The DPP is traditionally pro-independence and Tsai has refused to acknowledge Beijing’s stance that Taiwan is part of “one China”, unlike her KMT predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou.</p><p>Ahead of the vote, Tsai and DPP officials repeatedly accused China of meddling in the lead-up to the elections by operating a “fake news” campaign. Beijing has denied the allegations.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(7,'https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/24/taiwan-same-sex-marriage-vote-referendum','The Guardian',NULL,'\nUncertainty grips gay people in Taiwan as same-sex marriage goes to the vote\n\nUncertainty grips gay people in Taiwan as same-sex marriage goes to the vote\n','\n\nA landmark court ruling left Taiwan set to become the first Asian nation to legalise gay marriage.

We feel our human rights are in the hands of others. The majority will vote on the rights of the gay community instead of those rights being universal and that, to me, is very upsetting.”</p><p>Taiwanese voters will determine the outcome of 10 referendums alongside local government elections, with five of them addressing same-sex marriage, one of three major issues.</p><p>In an attempt to derail the ruling by the constitutional court, the group Alliance for Next Generation’s Happiness collected enough support to trigger a referendum against amending the existing civil code to allow same sex-couples to marry.</p><p>Other groups have mounted a referendum proposing a separate legal mechanism for gay couples to register their relationships.</p><p>In response, pro-LGBT campaigners have put forward their own referendum stating that the code should be amended. Confusingly, the public will therefore be asked to vote on contradictory proposals.</p><p>Chen says: “I’m not feeling very positive about the result because the opposition has used its financial resources to gain support by spreading fear, misinformation, lies and rumours via social media, TV adverts and print media.</p><p>“Our concern is the government will use the results as the basis to modify the law and may come up with watered down legislation that does not fully protect our rights.”</p><p>Same-sex couples want the civil code amended to give them the same rights as heterosexuals, rather than new legislation being introduced in the form of a same-sex marriage act.</p><p>Chen, who is Zola’s biological mother, says: “For us the most important thing is to see the civil code amended so we share the same rights as heterosexual couples. Our concern is a a separate law will be passed to give us the right to civil partnership but not adoption rights. Then my wife would not be able to exercise her legal parenting rights of our daughter.”</p><p>Under Taiwan’s Referendum Act, if more than 25% of the country’s estimated 20 million eligible voters are in favour, and “yes” votes surpass “no” votes, then a bill must be drawn up to reflect the results before a parliamentary vote is held.</p><p>However, analysts say current law does not specify what the process would be if two conflicting referendums passed.</p><p>Pro-rights campaigners say this scenario could have been avoided if President Tsai Ing-wen and her party had taken action sooner to adopt the 2017 ruling. Tsai campaigned for gay rights before her election as president in 2016. But her party has remained divided on the issue in the face of fierce opposition from the church.</p><p>“Our court ruled parliament has to amend the civil code or introduce a new law to legalise gay marriage by 24 May 2019,” explains Victoria Hsu, who was the lead lawyer in the marriage equality case that led to the 2017 ruling.</p><p>“Because our government did not respond quickly the Christian churches in Taiwan have proposed three referendum questions that were approved by the central electoral commission.”</p><p>They include an attempt to ban LGBT-inclusive education in primary and junior high schools, despite Taiwan passing a gender equality act in 2004 requiring schools to teach gender equality and diversity.</p><p>Hsu, co-founder of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights, says the leading party has been largely silent on the issue of same-sex marriage in order to protect its votes from the conservative right in these local elections.</p><p>“They fully understand they can’t postpone this issue forever, but have been hesitant as part of a political calculation. They have allowed the referendum to go first to serve as some kind of public opinion survey.”</p><p>She says the administrative cabinet of Taiwan’s government has recently clarified its position, stating gay marriage will go ahead regardless of the referendum result.</p><p>“The only difference would be to amend the civil code or introduce a separate law called the same-sex marriage act. However, anti-gay groups have led their supporters to believe they can stop gay marriage, which is ridiculous.</p><p>“They have spent a lot on spreading fear, misinformation and homophobic rhetoric. If they are successful in getting more votes, they will try to push our government to pass a lightweight act compared with the civil code.”</p><p>Ying-Chao Kao, assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, says the conservative forces have roughly 10 times more money and resources than the pro-LGBT campaign.</p><p>“In the past six months, the conservative campaigns have produced fear, anxiety, depression and moral panic,” he says. “There were two LGBT members who committed suicide before the referendum. LGBT friends around me, including opinion leaders on Facebook, are trying to save lives. They are saying: ‘Even if we lose the campaign please stay with us, there is still hope.’</p><p>“If you look at the available finance and infrastructure to mobilise each side, the gap is huge – but the support rates are relatively similar. However, the most important determinant factor will be voter turnout.”</p><p>The issue is divided along generational rather than political lines and, with Taiwan lowering the voting age for the first time in a referendum from 20 to 18, the LGBT campaign will be looking to the urban youth to come out in force.</p><p>According to a July survey conducted by the Marriage Equality Coalition, more than 80% of the population below the age of 35 supports same-sex marriage, compared with 30% of over 45s.</p><p>Kao says: “These young people have been educated about LGBT issues and have greater exposure to the community. If marriage equality wins, Taiwan will make another huge leap towards a mature democracy with a commitment to human rights.”</p><p>In the meantime, Chen and Chiang are holding off on planning the celebrations for their big day. “Having a wedding is a wonderful idea but we are really disappointed by the government and have lost confidence,” says Chiang.</p><p>“If the civil code is amended, we will rush to register as a married couple and adopt our daughter to establish our legal parenting rights. We want her to feel free to be herself and realise her dreams, because her mothers have fought for her rights.”</p><p>The Guardian approached the Alliance for Next Generation’s Happiness for a comment but has not had a response.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(8,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/taiwan-gay-marriage-referendum-vote','The Guardian',NULL,'\nSex, lies and heated debate: Taiwan prepares to vote in gay marriage referendum\n','\n\nThe social media myths are spreading as Taiwan gets ready to decide on marriage equality\n',NULL,'\nBenjamin Haas in Seoul','2018-11-22T00:48:23+0000',1542847703000,'<p>Taiwan is in the final days of a battle over the future of equality in the country, with conservatives campaigning fiercely against LGBT advocates over a referendum on same-sex marriage on Saturday.</p><p>When Taiwan’s highest court ruled last year that same-sex marriage should be legal, supporters rejoiced after waging a years-long battle for equality. But after conservative groups rallied against the change, the government announced a referendum on the issue in August.</p><p>As voting day nears, conservative groups have deployed a reported budget of 100m Taiwan dollars (£2.5m) in an effort to push the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman only. The group Alliance for Next Generation’s Happiness, which gathered enough signatures to trigger the referendum, voiced fears for society, with spokesman Tseng Hsien-ying saying: “The collapse of the family system will deal a huge blow to society.”</p><p>Advertisements have blanketed Taiwan’s airwaves and newspapers. Misinformation has spread on social media, with same-sex marriage opponents claiming marriage equality would affect the island’s falling birthrate and make it a haven for foreigners with HIV who seek to use the national health system.</p><p>On the other side, a range of celebrities and 27 major corporations, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, have supported calls for same-sex marriage. About 100,000 people attended a rally in support of marriage equality a week before the vote in Taipei, according to local media. But polling suggests equality advocates may have a tough time at the polls. About 77% support defining marriage as between one man and one woman, according to the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation.</p><p>Taiwan had been set to become the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage when the island’s highest court said in May 2017 that barring gay couples from marrying violated “the people’s freedom of marriage” and “the people’s right to equality”.</p><p>“Sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic that is resistant to change,” the court said in its ruling. “The freedom of marriage for two persons of the same sex, once legally recognised, will constitute the collective basis, together with opposite-sex marriage, for a stable society.”</p><p>The ruling required same-sex marriage to be legalised within two years. While some form of legal recognition for same-sex couples is inevitable given the court’s ruling, conservatives hope to limit it to civil partnerships rather than amending the civil code on marriage.</p><p>As part of the reforms last year to increase participation in policy making among ordinary citizens, the government made it easier to propose referendums, lowering the number of signatures required to 280,000 signatures – equivalent to 1.5% of the electorate.</p><p>The situation has lead to a confusing ballot on Saturday, with a total of five questions related to same-sex life on the island, two with language in favour and three opposed. One of the questions concerns including LGBTQ material in the national curriculum, something conservatives hope to ban. It is unclear what would happen if several of the conflicting referendums pass.</p><p>Taiwanese will also be voting on a range of other issues, from nuclear and coal power use to food imports from Japan to the name used in Olympic competition, which could potentially see Taiwan barred from the 2020 Games in Tokyo.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(9,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/chinas-oscars-tawian-independence-golden-horse-awards-beijing-cuts-live-coverage','The Guardian',NULL,'\nChinese Oscars: Beijing cuts live coverage after winner calls for independent Taiwan\n','\n\nSpeech by documentary filmmaker Fu Yue censored after she calls for Taiwan to be recognised as an ‘independent entity’\n',NULL,'\nBenjamin Haas in Seoul','2018-11-20T03:20:08+0000',1542684008000,'<p>The Chinese-language version of the Oscars, the Golden Horse Awards, have become the latest flashpoint in tense relations between China and Taiwan after a film director questioned the island’s political status.</p><p>Documentary filmmaker Fu Yue called for Taiwan to be recognised as an “independent entity” during her acceptance speech, fighting back tears as she said, “this is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese”. Her speech was quickly censored on Chinese television and streams, with the coverage going black.</p><p>For decade China has claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, but the island has been independently ruled since 1949, and in the past two decades has become a flourishing democracy in contrast to Beijing’s authoritarian government. Chinese officials often bristle at suggestions of Taiwanese independence, and have gone to great lengths to poach Taiwan’s diplomatic allies.</p><p>After Fu’s comments, a mainland Chinese actor, Tu Men, echoed Beijing’s line on the status of the island, referring to it as “Taiwan, China”, drawing a rebuke from Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen.</p><p>“We have never accepted the phrase “Taiwan, China”, and we never will accept this phrase, Taiwan is simply Taiwan,” Tsai wrote in an online post. “I am proud of yesterday’s Golden Horse Awards, which highlights the fact that Taiwan is different from China, and our freedom and diversity is why this is a land where artistic creations can be free.”</p><p>Chinese authorities have banned their citizens from participating in the ceremony next year, according to reports in Taiwanese media.</p><p>The debate comes ahead of local elections in Taiwan, which are widely seen as a referendum on Tsai’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive party (DPP). The controversy quickly spread online, where each side took turns praising or condemning Fu’s actions.</p><p>Chinese actress Fan Bingbing, who disappeared earlier this year only to reemerge after admitting to tax evasion, used her now mostly dormant social media account to post a map of China with the phrase “China cannot lose one bit of itself”. The image was first posted several years ago by the Communist Youth League, and nationalism has seen a sharp rise under president Xi Jinping.</p><p>That national fervour may have cost a Chinese runner first place in the Suzhou marathon, after organisers tried to thrust a Chinese flag into her hand during the final stretch of the race.

Trump has opened up a new line of criticism in recent weeks, accusing China of meddling in US elections but without presenting substantive evidence of interference.</p><p>In a tweet on Thursday, Trump said he had spoken with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.

By turns galumphing and graceful, the roughly £260m hulk contains an opera house, concert hall, theatre and recital hall, seating up to 7,000 people within its curvaceous shell. As Taiwan faces ever more pressure for assimilation from mainland China, whose cultural building boom has led to a new museum or concert hall open practically every week in recent years, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts, AKA Weiwuying, is a monumental statement that this plucky nation means business on the international cultural stage.</p><p>Gaping openings in the building’s hefty flanks beckon you into a cave-like landscape, where the floor rides up in great waves as the ceiling plunges down to meet the ground, forming a world of tunnels and canyons. The glossy-white steel skin is sliced open in places, bringing shafts of light into the space and offering intriguing glimpses of the venues within. It provides cooling respite from the tropical heat of this coastal city, channelling the breeze beneath its bulging belly to make a welcome place for picnics, tai-chi, yoga classes and some exhilarating swings.</p><p>“We were struck by the informality of the performing arts in Taiwan,” says Dutch architect Francine Houben, whose practice, Mecanoo (designers of the Birmingham Library), won the competition for the project in 2007. “Chinese opera has its origins in street theatre, so we wanted to make a place that would feel as casual and informal as going to see a performance in the park.”</p><p>The venue’s ambience is more that of a leisure centre than an opera house, particularly compared with Taipei’s national theatre and concert hall, each built in 1987, which stand on either side of the capital’s central square, like a pair of regal temples from the Forbidden City. By contrast, Weiwuying’s artistic director, Chien Wen-Pin, hopes people will spill into its theatres from the park, and treat it as their living room. “We had over 50,000 people turn up to our open day,” he says. “People occupied the space in a way were weren’t planning or expecting, taking their shoes off, doing exercise, lying in the shade, even breaking into song as they entered the concert hall.”</p><p>Featuring the largest organ in Asia, designed as two thickets of bamboo with more than 9,000 pipes, the concert hall is a swirling symphony of oak and champagne-coloured seats, with a 22-tonne acoustic reflector dangling ominously from the ceiling. Despite its 2,000-person capacity, it feels surprisingly intimate, the furthest seat being 30 metres from the conductor. The Parisian magician of acoustics, Albert Xu, built a 1:10 model of it to ensure it provides the perfect reverberation time for everything from a classical orchestra to the twanging of the Taiwanese aboriginal mouth harp. He also worked his magic on the other three spaces, each designed with a distinct character and calibrated to accommodate a variety of art forms.</p><p>The 434-seat recital hall has an asymmetrical seating layout, “so more people can see the pianists’ fingers”, say the architects, while its panelled walls can rotate to provide different levels of absorption, whether it’s hosting harsher classical Chinese music or jazz, or softer baroque chamber music. The playhouse, with deep blue seats, can accommodate an orchestra to the side of the stage (important for Chinese opera, where there must be a direct line of sight between the musicians and performers). Meanwhile, the deep red 2,236-seat opera house enjoys a humungous backstage, four times the size of the auditorium, conceived as a “theatre machine” that can contain the scenery and equipment for five different shows at once. “It’s even bigger and better equipped than Beijing’s opera,” Houben whispers conspiratorially about an important point of national pride.</p><p>If the auditoria are exemplars of their kind, then the circulation and foyer space between them feels a little like an afterthought. With the four ovoid venues set in a rectangular volume stretching 225 metres long by 160 metres wide, there is a lot of leftover space, mainly decked out with acres of grey carpet, plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, every surface painted black or white, giving it a rather bleak, monotonous feeling. Within the building there is little of the spatial drama promised by the undulating plaza outside. Instead, it has the air of a deep-plan office block with theatrical ambitions.</p><p>The architects are quick to point out that the budget is actually very tight for a project of this scale, which necessitated some of the prosaic fittings. While Jean Nouvel’s Philharmonie de Paris cost £340m, and Herzog & de Meuron’s Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg was a whopping £690m (each housing a single auditorium), Mecanoo has provided four theatres in one for a fraction of the price.</p><p>The robust, rough-and-ready quality is also somehow appropriate for the nature of this no-nonsense port city. “We wanted it to have the detailing of a cargo ship, not a luxury yacht,” says Houben, referring to the visible steel welding joints between the panels of the building’s billowing white hull. Those who aren’t told of the container ship allusion might just think it is badly finished, but various nautical markings reinforce the seafaring air.</p><p>The bigger question is if this city of three million, which has enjoyed a single 1,600-capacity theatre until now, has the ability to fill such an enormous complex on a regular basis. The director of the £106m National Taichung theatre, another ambitious cave-like opera house, an hour away by train and built by Toyo Ito in 2015, admits it is struggling to sell tickets to its current run of Wagner’s Siegfried, after the novelty of the venue’s opening has worn off. Taipei, meanwhile, awaits the opening of its long-delayed £133m performing arts centre designed by OMA, another theatre, concert hall and blackbox auditorium combined in a thrilling multilayered transformer of a building.</p><p>It is an extraordinary abundance of venues for one country to be opening in the span of a few years, all planned in the mid-2000s by different regional and national administrations.

They then sorted the participants into four groups, from lowest to highest levels of exposure.</p><p>After taking into account factors including age, exposure to ozone, levels of other particulates, age, smoking status and whether the men chewed betel quid – a mixture of ingredients that includes areca nut and betel leaf and is known to increase the risk of mouth cancer – the researchers found that men exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5s had an increased risk of mouth cancer.</p><p>Air pollution has previously been linked with several types of cancer</p><p>Compared with men exposed to average annual PM2.5 levels of 26.74 micrograms (μg) per cubic metre (m3) of air, those exposed to concentrations of 40.37 μg/m3 or higher had 43% greater odds of developing the disease.</p><p>“The mechanism through which this occurs is not clearly understood, hence further investigations are required,” the researchers write.</p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has previously said average annual levels of PM2.5s should not exceed 10 μg/m3. While in central London the average annual figures have been found to be double this, they are still far lower than the highest levels seen in the Taiwanese study.</p><p>However, many other cities around the world have extremely high levels of air pollution. According to figures from the WHO, the average annual level of PM2.5s in Kabul is 86 μg/m3, while in Beijing it is 85 μg/m3 and in Delhi it has been recorded at 122 μg/m3.</p><p>But the study has limitations, including that it is does not consider the men’s previous exposure to air pollution over their lifetime – which may have been higher or lower than their recent exposure.</p><p>Prof Frank Kelly, chair in environmental health at King’s College London, who was not involved in the study, said it would be useful to explore whether a link between mouth cancer and air pollution is seen in other countries.</p><p>“Air pollution has previously been linked with several types of cancer, including breast, liver, lung and pancreatic cancer. It is therefore not surprising that this new study in Taiwan has made a possible link with mouth cancer,” he said. “However, given that air pollution concentrations and smoking incidence are much lower in the UK and we don’t chew betel all suggest that the increased risk of developing mouth cancer may be unique to Taiwan.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(15,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/keir-starmer-visits-taiwan-to-lobby-against-death-penalty','The Guardian',NULL,'\nKeir Starmer visits Taiwan to lobby against death penalty\n','\n\nLabour frontbencher and former DPP will meet senior judiciary and politicians\n',NULL,'\nOwen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent','2018-09-29T10:05:34+0100',1538211934000,'<p>Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, will fly out to Taiwan this weekend to lobby against the death penalty in an initiative also aimed at demonstrating the UK’s continued commitment to international legal standards following the EU referendum.</p><p>His four-day trip, which is supported by the Foreign Office, will include meetings with the country’s vice-president, minister of justice and senior judiciary.

Asia remains one region where the death penalty is still widely used.</p><p>Taiwan adopted a moratorium on using the death penalty but on 31 August, Lee Hung-chi, who was convicted of murdering his ex-wife and daughter, was shot through the heart from behind – the country’s routine method for carrying out executions.</p><p>Starmer, who visited Taiwan two years ago, told the Guardian: “The most important thing is to ensure that the moratorium stays in place. One of the most important points to emphasise after the referendum is the UK’s continued commitment to international law … across the world.</p><p>“For me personally, and the country, compliance with international human rights obligations has always been central and I have devoted much of my career to that cause ... Going to Taiwan is part of maintaining the UK’s commitment to international human rights.”</p><p>Saul Lehrfreund, a solicitor at the London law firm Simons Muirhead & Burton and co-founder of the Death Penalty Project, is accompanying Starmer to Taiwan. He said: “We will be raising the case of Lee. Taiwan has not said it will abolish the death penalty tomorrow, but has stated that it’s a long-term objective.”</p><p>Lehrfreund has also been to talk to authorities in China about the death penalty. Chinese executions have declined in number: 25 years ago as many 25,000 prisoners were being killed every year. The current figure is believed to be roughly 3,000 executions.</p><p>“The reality is that miscarriages of justice are inevitable anywhere in the world. An individual on death row in Taiwan was exonerated recently after spending 10 years on death row.”</p><p>The UK’s commitment to opposing the death penalty has been questioned since the government signalled in July that it may allow two terror suspects, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, who have been detained in Iraq, to be extradited to the US, where they could face the death penalty. </p><p>The Foreign Office said: “It is a longstanding policy of the UK government to oppose the death penalty, in all circumstances, as a matter of principle.”</p><p>The department said it worked closely, through the Magna Carta Fund, with abolitionist organisations such as the Death Penalty Project to reduce the number of executions and restrict use of the death penalty.</p><p>Asked about the Isis suspects, the spokesperson said: “We are clear that any foreign fighters who may be captured in an armed conflict should be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and brought to justice in accordance with legal due process.”</p><p>Starmer is due to return to the UK on Thursday after the end of the Conservative party conference. In an article he and Lehfreund have written for Taiwanese papers, they said: “The global experience shows that support for capital punishment dwindles after abolition as the punishment comes to be outdated.</p><p>“There are many unanswered questions about Lee’s death that make it sit so uncomfortably with a commitment towards abolition, including that his original sentence of life imprisonment was increased to death on appeal, the lingering and serious concerns as to Lee’s mental health and his apparent unwillingness to appeal or seek clemency … It has been made repeatedly clear that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(16,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/22/vatican-and-china-sign-agreement-on-bishop-appointments','The Guardian',NULL,'\nVatican and China sign agreement on bishop appointments\n','\n\nHistoric accord was announced during Pope Francis’s visit to Lithuania\n',NULL,'Reuters in Vilnius','2018-09-22T12:04:55+0100',1537614295000,'<p>The Vatican and China have signed a historic provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops.</p><p>The agreement was signed in Beijing and announced while Pope Francis was visiting Lithuania at the start of a four-day trip to the Baltic countries.</p><p>The Vatican said the accord was “not political, but pastoral”.</p><p>China cut off diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951.

Fifty years later, the fall of Japan in the Second World War in turn allowed China to regain its former authority.</p><p>When the ousted Chiang and his Kuomintang (KMT) acolytes arrived in 1945, they took control of Taiwan and ran the territory as the Republic of China in exile, an effective dictatorship, provoking deep resentment from the locals. They intended to use it as a base from which to retake their former homeland, a hope dashed after the UN officially recognised Mao’s People’s Republic as the true China in 1971.</p><p>The exile’s son, Chiang Cing-kuo, subsequently began the process of democratisation. By the end of the 1970s, relations with China had improved and mutual restrictions on travel and investment were relaxed, even though Taiwan had snubbed the mainland’s overtures on reunification. </p><p>It was at this juncture that Taiwan emerged as an industrial powerhouse, enjoying rapid economic growth and establishing itself as a manufacturing hub, specialising in tech and electronics for global export.</p><p>Its first non-KMT leader, Chen Shui-bian, was elected in 2000 and his open support for an independent Taiwan did much to sour the peace.</p><p>The more moderate Ma Ying-jeo’s victory eight years later provided Beijing with a more palatable alternative but Ms Tsai’s assent to power in 2016 as head of the Democratic Progressive Party once more drew the issue of Taiwanese independence into the spotlight.</p><p>US president Donald Trump called Ms Tsai to congratulate her on her victory, breaking with American foreign policy in place since the Jimmy Carter administration in 1979, risking the ire of Xi Jinping.</p><p>By making the call, Mr Trump implicitly acknowledged (intentionally or by accident) Taiwan’s sovereignty and President Tsai’s status as a head of state and world leader, in defiance of China.</p><p>The US remains Taiwan’s biggest ally but walks a difficult tightrope, respecting China by not overtly stating its preference for a free Taiwan while simultaneously honouring the bond forged with the island during the Pacific campaign of the Second World War by offering “defensive” military support in the event Taipei should come under attack.</p><p>How serious is President Xi’s statement?</p><p>China’s president stressed his ambitions for Taiwan were in the greater interests of national security and centred around “peaceful reunification”.</p><p>“China won’t attack Chinese people. We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”, he said.</p><p>But despite the broadly conciliatory tone, he refused to rule out a military conquest: “We will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.”</p><p>“We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means... The issue of Taiwan is part of China’s domestic politics and foreign interference is intolerable.”</p><p>Mr Xi’s proposal for unification is a one-country, two-system framework akin to that seen in Hong Kong since Britain handed over sovereignty to China in 1997. Such a deal would respect the Taiwanese social system and way of life and guarantee their property rights, religious beliefs and other rights, he said. </p><p>But similar pledges concerning the future of Hong Kong have not prevented Beijing tightening its grip on the city, with activists voicing fears about growing pressure on democratic freedoms.</p><p>For her part, President Tsai responded to her counterpart’s remarks by rejecting the Hong Kong model, calling on China to respect Taiwanese sovereignty, leaving the matter in its customary stalemate.</p>',NULL,NULL,'undefined'),(3,'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taiwan-us-china-president-tasi-ing-wen-visit-houston-trump-a8499006.html','INDEPEDENT',NULL,'China enraged as Taiwan president’s US visit shows growing support in Congress ','United States has not officially recognised Taiwan since 1979 but relations between Washington and Taipei appear to be strengthening\n',NULL,'Chris Horton','2018-08-20T10:21:56+01:00',1534756916000,'<p>President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan visited Houston over the weekend, her second brief stop in the United States in one week, a sign of efforts to deepen relations between Washington and Taipei despite vehement opposition from China.</p><p>Ms Tsai stopped in Los Angeles last Monday, on her way to Paraguay and Belize, and then in Houston on Saturday on her way back home. During the earlier stop, she met with three California lawmakers, including one, Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat, who called on the United States to formally invite her to Washington, which would break with decades of American practice.</p><p>The United States has not officially recognised Taiwan since 1979, when it shifted to recognising China’s communist government. China hopes to absorb the self-governed, democratic island, which it has never controlled, and has campaigned to erase any recognition by other countries or corporations of Taiwan’s sovereignty.</p><p>The visits to Houston and Los Angeles are considered “transit stops” rather than official visits, part of a long-standing restriction imposed by the United States to maintain better relations with China. But Beijing has objected even to such brief stop-overs, and the most recent ones came after President Donald Trump demonstrated willingness to provoke China’s anger.</p><p>Mr Trump has imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, touching off a trade war, and in March he signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the kind of high-level, official visits the United States and Taiwan have not had in many years. Ms Tsai’s most recent transit stops were her first since Mr Trump signed the act into law.</p><p>While there were no expectations that Mr Trump would meet his Taiwanese counterpart, there were small indications that the United States was willing to be more welcoming to Taiwanese presidents.</p><p>In a first, Taiwanese journalists were permitted to follow Ms Tsai and report from the sites of events she attended. She visited Taiwan’s de facto consulate in Los Angeles – another first – and she addressed American media at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Los Angeles.</p><p>“There were pictures of her meeting crowds of local Taiwanese, accompanied by police escort, and giving a speech at the Reagan library,” said Julian Ku, professor at Hofstra Law School. “All of that significantly raised her public profile and made her seem more like a normal leader making a normal visit to a foreign country.”</p><p>She met with Republican and Democratic members of Congress, underscoring the strong bipartisan support for Taiwan.</p><p>In China, however, Ms Tsai elicits hateful commentary on a level that perhaps only the Dalai Lama can match. Shortly after she visited a Los Angeles location of the Taiwanese coffee chain 85C, the Chinese internet erupted with anger, calling for a boycott of the chain’s several hundred locations in China, its largest market.</p><p>That day, 85C’s parent company, Gourmet Master, whose stock trades on Taiwan’s exchange, lost $120 million in share value. The company promptly apologised and expressed support for peaceful unification.</p><p>Many Taiwanese were upset by the company caving in to Chinese pressure, with some also calling for a boycott of the chain. Polls consistently show that the overwhelming majority of people in Taiwan, a multiparty democracy, oppose being absorbed into China’s one-party, authoritarian rule.</p><p>The episode is the latest example of the Chinese government using its grip on the country’s enormous market to pressure corporations into serving its political agenda.

It was a mistake. Whether he misunderstood me or not he declared, with due menace, that any challenge to China’s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan would mean war. Apart from that, our meeting was a great success.</p><p>It was a very forceful reminder of just how sensitive an issue Taiwan is for the Chinese government. The very word “Taiwan” is guaranteed to bristle with any official as I, in my own small way, discovered.</p><p>Now Xi Jinping has once again raised the issue, on the 40th anniversary of a landmark “message to compatriots” that urged Taiwan to embark upon peaceful reunification. The president was conciliatory – but, as has long been the case, he refused to rule out military action if Beijing’s ambitions are rudely thwarted by a declaration of independence from Taiwan.</p><p>This matters more than most distant territorial scraps because it is part of a long list of Chinese geopolitical grievances. Though its support of Taiwan is far weaker than it used to be, America is still the guarantor of Taiwan’s security and is therefore a third party in the dispute. President Trump’s trade war with China (and a complex range of territorial waters disputes with, among others, the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia) also adds to the tensions, and they have started to fester and feed upon each other.</p><p>The obvious answer is for President Trump and President Xi to settle all these matters with a “grand bargain”. The outlines of this are already clear: the prize for Beijing is reunification, and the US should usher Taiwan towards reunification under the “one nation, two systems” model proposed by China. This model was broadly followed when Hong Kong and Macau were handed back by Britain and Portugal in the 1990s. It would be a fine thing for the Chinese president to present to his people on the 70th anniversary of the revolution this year.</p><p>In return, China should stop manipulating its currency and distorting its economy, and eliminate its still vast trade surplus with the US to trivial levels. It should also settle up its more outrageous claims to the seas around its coastline.</p><p>Chuck in some environmental initiatives (which would also level the economic playing field), a clampdown on intellectual property theft and some reduction in China’s neocolonial activities in Africa, and the world could be a much safer, more prosperous place. As Nixon and Henry Kissinger recognised half a century ago, it would also reset the balance of power away from the other global superpower, Russia.</p><p>With strong leaders – and Trump and Xi at least qualify as that – such a deal is surely possible. </p><p>Moreover, the Chinese claim to Taiwan is difficult to argue with. Taiwan is simply a post Cold War anomaly. China’s offer was perfectly clear and fair – especially if Taiwan is accepted to be part of China, as it has long been (and as the Taiwanese government once used to so violently insist). Xi said, for example: “On the basis of ensuring China’s sovereignty, security and interests of development, the social system and way of life in Taiwan will be fully respected, and the private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected after peaceful reunification is realised.”</p><p>More ominously, and as ever, there is a threat: “We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.”</p><p>Taiwan has soured relations between the west and Beijing since 1949, when Mao won the civil war and his opponents, the Kuomintang, fled to a few offshore islands, the largest of which was Taiwan, itself recently occupied by imperial Japan. It is rather as if a bunch of renegades in the English Civil War in the seventeenth century wound up on the Isle of Wight and declared themselves the sole legitimate government of the entire nation. Having failed in that quixotic enterprise, they now wish to declare themselves independent. That is, more or less, what is happening in Taiwan. It is getting a bit ridiculous, and it is maddening the Chinese government.</p><p>Increasingly anachronistic, Taiwan – even now formally known as the Republic of China – used to claim sovereignty over the entire nation, and was backed in its claim by a belligerent America. The US refused to recognise even the existence of “Red China” until president Richard Nixon, the former Cold War warrior, made his historic trip to the People’s Republic in 1972 and president Jimmy Carter normalised diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979. The PRC then also displaced Taiwan on the UN Security Council.</p><p>Since then, the Taiwanese have been slowly losing the diplomatic and, for that matter, the economic battle with a reforming, growing China. In the Mao era, China was an economic pygmy; today its economy is the largest in the world, if you remove the distortions of exchange rates. It is bigger than America and Germany combined, seven times bigger than Britain, and 20 times larger than Taiwan. The People’s Army has a million soldiers. It has 260 nuclear warheads. Diplomacy has to take some account of these towering realities. </p><p>The irony is that where once “Nationalist” Taiwan used to stress the unity of China and its claim of sovereignty over the entire territory, it is now Beijing that is anxious to reassert its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, while many Taiwanese want formal independence.</p><p>Referring to recent setbacks for her party, the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, now declares: “I must emphasise that the election results absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favours abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.” No – but they would like their economy to start growing again, and the obvious answer to that is economic reunification with the mainland.</p><p>The election of a female president in Taiwan in 2016 from a party that couldn’t have existed for most of Taiwan’s history in the one-party state run by the Kuomintang highlights the big new barrier to Chinese reunification. This is the second irony: this is no longer a tussle between opposing authoritarian ideologies – communist dictatorship China vs capitalist dictatorship China, as Taiwan is now a full democracy and China is no longer fully communist. It does feel bad to be abandoning a proper democracy such as Taiwan.</p><p>Yet China’s overwhelming military and economic superiority in the region does, indeed, as President Xi implies, mean that reunification is inevitable.</p><p>History proves that the most successful diplomatic initiatives, the ones that seem so bold and innovative at the time, are merely the acceptance of the inevitable: Nixon’s historic mission to China itself; the release of Nelson Mandela and a multi-racial South Africa; the existence of the state of Israel; the end of the British Empire and its transformation into a Commonwealth; the collapse of the USSR. These moments in history all required transforming a kind of defeat into a victory. Xi Jinping plainly sees this, and perhaps the authorities in Taiwan too. If only we could be confident that Trump is also willing to accept reality.</p><p>There seems to be a growing mood of hawkishness towards China in the US administration – a hostile speech by US vice president Mike Pence last year being a prominent example. Western security services fret about the power of Chinese companies such as Huawei, and arrest its executives. It is, frankly, getting very dangerous.</p><p>Time for a Xi-Trump summit, and a “grand bargain”.

This time around, it is not just about China.</p><p>Reflecting 16 years of political changes and concomitant rising Taiwan identity, the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum opened its doors to the public in September as Taiwan’s new government looks to play down its connections to China while moving toward greater engagement with the rest of Asia.</p><p>Unlike its namesake in Taipei, where Chinese culture takes center stage, the museum, based in the southwestern county of Chiayi, celebrates the interconnectedness and cross-pollination of Asian cultures over the centuries. Current exhibits employ motifs including goods such as textiles, ceramics and tea, as well as references to Buddhism and Islam, to highlight the shared heritage of the world’s most populous continent.</p><p>An 18th-century green embroidered damask coat featuring Ottoman design, Chinese fabric and Russian lining hangs among Javanese sarongs and royal attire from South Asia. A statue of a Maitreya Buddha from Pakistan stands adjacent to a bronze Buddha head from 17th-century Burma. Twelfth-century ceramic arhats from Korea’s Goryeo kingdom look quizzically across a hall at Edo-era tea ware from Japan.</p><p>“It’s a global view of Asia,” said Wang Shih-Sheng, the museum’s chief curator. “Most of our artifacts come from our collection in Taipei, but when planning the project, we decided to look at things from an Asian perspective.”</p><p>The Taipei museum opened in 1965 and was used by Taiwan’s Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek as a source of local legitimacy vis-à-vis Mao’s Communists, the victors of the Chinese civil war. The museum was also employed as a tool for imposing a Chinese identity upon Taiwan residents.</p><p>Along with the Nationalists came more than 600,000 artifacts from the Palace Museum in Beijing, which was founded in 1925, the year after China’s last emperor, Puyi, who had not held the title of emperor since a short-lived restoration to the throne in 1917, was evicted from the Forbidden City. Before his expulsion, it became apparent that he and his court were selling off national treasures to survive.</p><p>Most of the items that survived the difficult voyage to Taiwan were produced by Chinese kingdoms and dynasties or nearby kingdoms, such as Tibet, who paid tribute to and traded with their Chinese neighbors.</p><p>Other items, however, came from further afield. Of little political use to the Nationalists, they took on a new significance after the election of Chen Shui- bian to the presidency of the Republic of China, as Taiwan has been called since 1945.</p><p>Mr. Chen was a member of the Democratic Progress Party, which sits at the center of the “pan-green” political camp in Taiwan’s politics that emphasizes Taiwan’s unique identity and prefers to keep the country self-determined. The party’s rise in the 2000 elections added a new voice to Taiwan’s identity politics in Taipei’s halls of power. By 2003, the idea of a new and very different branch of the National Palace Museum gained traction among pan-greens.</p><p>The man assigned to coordinate across ministries to establish the museum was Lin Sheng-Fong, who was Minister of State at the time and is now an associate professor of architecture at Shih Chien University in Taipei.</p><p>“There was a common belief that the Taipei Palace Museum had a huge collection and only a fraction of it was displayed,” Mr Lin said. “So we could create a second palace museum using the underdisplayed collection.”</p><p>Politicians in the sinocentric “pan-blue” camp that primarily includes the Nationalists were less enthusiastic, as were bureaucrats in the Taipei museum, Mr. Lin said. Deliberations concluded with Chiayi as the museum’s site and “Formosa in the great era of navigation” as its theme, he said.</p><p>A dispute with the initial architect, Antoine Predock, resulted in the stalling of the project. It restarted in 2010 with the involvement of the Taipei architect Kris Yao, who inherited a half-started project that presented several constraints, including an already-constructed shoreline on an artificial lake. Mr. Yao created a new design for the museum inspired by three primary strokes in Chinese calligraphy: one thick, one dry and one watery and smeared.</p><p>“It’s an abstraction of a very basic Chinese art translated into architecture,” Mr. Yao said.</p><p>The portion of the building representing the thick stroke contains the museum’s archive and exhibition area, which require minimal natural light to protect its contents. The dry stroke lets natural light in, and comprises the building’s exoskeleton, lobby and offices. The smeared stroke, embodying penetration, is composed of walking areas and the bridge that leads over the lake.</p><p>Inspired by his love of ancient Chinese bronzes, especially those of the Shang dynasty, Mr. Yao said he had digitized ancient dragon and cloud patterns for the scaly surface of the “thick stroke” portion of the building.</p><p>“It’s not a building, per se, it’s a form,” Mr. Yao said. “It sits on a totally green plain and is black and white.”</p><p>The museum’s prominence on Chiayi’s verdant coastal plain is a striking departure from the Taipei museum, a Chinese-style palace built into the side of a mountain. In his recent book “The Miraculous History of China’s Two Palace Museums,” the journalist Mark O’Neill wrote of Chiang’s demands for the National Palace Museum:</p><p>“The government wanted not only a traditional Chinese design that matched the art pieces inside but also a museum with the most modern conservation systems; it had to protect the pieces from earthquakes, typhoons, humidity, insects and air raids.”</p><p>A visit to the Taipei museum may leave visitors feeling adrift in the vast breadth of China’s geography and history. The Chiayi museum’s handful of exhibition rooms shrink both time and space, using Asia’s historical commercial and cultural exchanges, themselves often inseparable, to weave a regional patchwork that is neither exhaustive, nor exhausting. China’s important influence is not ignored, nor is it central to the museum.</p><p>Using the example of tea — a beverage that spread across ancient Asian trading routes — Ms. Wang expounded upon the shared differences of the museum’s exhibits.</p><p>“You can trace tea culture back to the Tang dynasty,” she said. “After arriving in other parts of Asia, it evolved because of local habits or culture,” with Tibetans adding yak butter or the Japanese grinding it to make matcha.</p><p>With the aim of creating the world’s top pan-Asian museum, Ms. Wang said the National Palace Museum would bring exhibitions in from other Asian collections around the world.</p><p>The ceramics hall, for example, currently displays Imari porcelain wares on loan from the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka. Future exhibitions will bring Japanese national treasures from the Tokyo National Museum and Kyushu National Museum, as well as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, she said.</p><p>Teresa Chiang, a Chiayi native visiting the museum with her parents and four-year-old daughter, said her first visit had left her feeling more connected to other Asian cultures. “At the Taipei museum you can’t enjoy Korean or Japanese culture,” she said. “Here you can see artifacts from all over Asia — I think it’s amazing.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/06/arts/06iht-RARTTAIWANa/06iht-RARTTAIWANa-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(3,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/business/international/taiwan-semiconductor-china-factory-chips.html','NY Times',NULL,'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to Open Own Plant in China',NULL,NULL,' Paul Mozur','2015-12-07',1449446400000,'<p>As many of its competitors in the chip industry form partnerships in China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said on Monday that it was taking a different route: setting up a new manufacturing plant without help from a local partner.</p><p>The move is designed to protect its technology while playing to a China market brimming with makers of inexpensive smartphones. It is charting a course between keeping complex chip production facilities outside China and licensing technology to Chinese partners.</p><p>In an announcement Monday, Taiwan Semiconductor said it had submitted an application to Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs to invest in an advanced chip production facility in Nanjing, China. The total value of the investment is expected to be about $3 billion, though a spokesman for the company said it expected to save money by using equipment from facilities in Taiwan and capitalizing on Chinese subsidies.</p><p>In a nod to concerns about advanced chip protection technology being leaked to Chinese competitors, Taiwan Semiconductor said in a separate statement that by the time the facility in China is up and running, an advanced operation in Taiwan would be churning out chips a generation more sophisticated.</p><p>The company added that it “comprehensively protects its proprietary information” and, in referring to its fabrication plant, emphasized that it would “have whole ownership of the fab in China, which will help protect our intellectual property rights.”</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor’s approach stands in contrast to some of its rivals and partners in chip making. With the Chinese government set to spend tens of billions of dollars to build its chip industry, many foreign companies have been setting up partnerships and licensing technology in China.</p><p>During the past year, Qualcomm has partnered with the Chinese chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International to develop advanced chip production; Intel has invested in a subsidiary of China’s new national chip champion, Tsinghua Unigroup; and IBM has licensed some of its chip technology to a smaller Chinese partner.</p><p>As new links have grown, so, too, have concerns. In the United States, politicians and defense analysts say they are worried about Chinese theft of technology or advantages gained by close cooperation in the semiconductor industry. Advanced chip technology powers supercomputers that are used to manage defense systems, research new weapons and model things like nuclear detonations.</p><p>With an economy still based heavily on the chip supply chain, Taiwan’s government has also been particularly careful about allowing its most advanced semiconductor firms, like Taiwan Semiconductor, to cooperate closely with China.</p><p>Still, the recent spending spree by the Chinese government and chip companies has made a major impression on the island, and people in the industry in Taiwan acknowledge that the Chinese market is critical. For example, in its statement Taiwan Semiconductor said more than 50 percent of its revenue over the past five years had come from Chinese customers.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/08/world/08Semiconductor-web/08Semiconductor-web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(4,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/arts/international/cloud-gate-dance-theater-a-roving-bounding-symbol-of-taiwan.html','NY Times',NULL,'Cloud Gate Dance Theater: A Roving, Bounding Symbol of Taiwan',NULL,NULL,' Amy Qin','2015-09-11',1441929600000,'<p>NEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan — Most people in Taiwan are probably aware of the island’s pre-eminent performance group, Cloud Gate Dance Theater, even if they have no interest in modern dance.</p><p>Board a bus or a subway here, and you may see images of the troupe’s dancers emblazoned on the sides. Visit the popular Tamsui district and you may catch a glimpse of the company’s gleaming new $22 million home, which opened in April. If you travel on China Airlines, Taiwan’s flagship carrier, you may even fly on the Cloud Gate Liveried Aircraft, adorned with dancers’ likenesses. The airline unveiled it last year, saying the troupe represented the “pinnacle of Taiwan culture.”</p><p>Founded in 1973, Cloud Gate was Taiwan’s first professional dance company. Forty-two years later, it has become a roving, bounding symbol of this island. On Wednesday, it will open the annual Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the United States premiere of a 2013 work, “Rice.” The visit, with performances through Saturday, will be its sixth to the academy, and its first stop on a tour that will include performances in Los Angeles (January) and Washington (February). The company moves on to Paris in the spring.</p><p>Promoting Taiwan’s image abroad is a responsibility that Cloud Gate’s founder, artistic director and chief choreographer, Lin Hwai-Min, 68, does not take lightly.</p><p>“He’s a very public figure,” said Yatin Lin (no relation), a professor of dance studies at Taipei National University of the Arts. “Because of the political situation with mainland China, it’s very difficult for our political leaders to be active abroad, so many people see him as not just an artist but as a kind of cultural ambassador for Taiwan.”</p><p>This month, that commitment was on display as the choreographer marched into the rehearsal theater at the company’s new complex, clad in his signature uniform (black T-shirt, black pants) and brandishing a black backpack and a pack of cigarettes. While he settled at a table facing the stage, the company’s 22 dancers readied themselves for their first full run-through of “Rice” in a month.</p><p>As the music — a compilation of Hakka folk songs, drumming and Western classical music — began, a lone dancer strode out holding a long, quivering rattan stick. In the next 70 minutes, the dancers stamped, leapt and folded and unfolded their bodies in a demonstration of Cloud Gate’s hybrid aesthetic, which combines Western classical dance techniques with Eastern “rounded” movements that draw on martial arts and tai chi. Missing from the run-through was the production’s backdrop, a sumptuous video filmed on location over a cycle of rice cultivation in Chihshang in southeastern Taiwan.</p><p>Mr. Lin sat mostly silent, scribbling notes and only intermittently shouting (“Don’t rush, don’t rush!” and “Breathe!”). After the dancers took their final, choreographed bows, he stood and went through his notes, working with individuals on minor tweaks. The rehearsal had gone well and now the dancers just needed to focus on taking care of their bodies for the coming season, he told them later as they sat around him on the stage, stretching and massaging their muscles with foam rollers.</p><p>Later, in the company’s offices, Mr. Lin talked about the obligations he felt toward the dancers and society.</p><p>“I often remind the dancers that when they are onstage, they are often the only Taiwanese people that a lot of people get to see that are actually labeled as Taiwanese,” he said.</p><p>Much has changed since Mr. Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947. Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang’s National Revolutionary Army fled here in 1949 after losing the civil war to Mao’s Chinese Communists. The Kuomintang ruled Taiwan with an authoritarian hand for decades until 1996, when Taiwanese voters elected their president for the first time. Taiwan has been considered a democracy ever since (and may elect its first female president in January), but the island remains a disputed territory.</p><p>Growing up as the oldest of five children, Mr. Lin nurtured multiple passions, for politics, writing and dance. Only years later, while a student at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, did he decide to pursue choreography. He had spent two summers in New York studying dance at the Martha Graham School, and after completing his degree at Iowa he returned to Taiwan, and soon started Cloud Gate.</p><p>The company’s birth came just two years after what Mr. Lin, like many other Taiwanese, sees as a defining moment in the nation’s recent political history: the 1971 resolution that displaced the government in Taipei as the representative of China at the United Nations in favor of the government in Beijing.</p><p>“When I started the company I said, ‘Composed by Chinese, choreographed by Chinese, danced by Chinese, for a Chinese audience,’ ” said Mr. Lin, whose family has lived in Taiwan for generations. “Then Taiwan was kicked out of the U.N. and all of a sudden I had to figure out who I was.”</p><p>The event inspired “Legacy” (1978), which portrayed the early history of Taiwan. It was followed by such works as “Songs of the Wanderers,” “Moon Water” and the “Cursive” trilogy.</p><p>Reviews of Cloud Gate’s performances in the United States have been mixed. Critics have lauded the company\'s East-meets-West approach, with Anna Kisselgoff writing in The New York Times in 2003 that “Moon Water” was a “work unlike any other.” But Alastair Macaulay of The Times wrote in 2011 that the works were “repetitive” and called “Water Stains on the Wall” “devoid of lightness and humor.”</p><p>As the company’s stature grew, so too did the modern dance scene in Taiwan.</p><p>“Before Cloud Gate, there wasn’t even such thing as a wuzhe,” said Ping Heng, 57, the founder and artistic director of Dance Forum Taipei, using the term for dancer. “Before, people thought dancing was something you could do in school, but it wasn’t something worthy of being a profession. They just called dancers ‘tiaowu de ren,’ ” literally, people who dance.</p><p>Lin Lee-Chen, 65, the founder and artistic director of the Legend Lin Dance Theater in Taipei, said, “The dance scene in Taiwan today is very diverse,” with dance companies “of all sizes and styles.”</p><p>When asked about his possible retirement, Mr. Lin of Cloud Gate was reluctant to comment. But he acknowledged that the company’s new complex, which he said would allow his troupe and other dance and theatrical ventures to perpetuate the “Cloud Gate energy,” would make it easier for him to step away.</p><p>Still, “I don’t want any statues,” he said. “I’m a Buddhist. I think everything is just illusory, especially for dancers.</p><p>“We know that dance happens, but it also vanishes when it happens,” he said. “All we are creating is air. We are giving society a different air, that’s all.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/15/arts/15CLOUDGATE-FLOATER/15CLOUDGATE-FLOATER-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(6,'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/asia/xi-jinping-taiwan-china.html','NY Times',NULL,'Xi Jinping Warns Taiwan That Unification Is the Goal and Force Is an Option',NULL,NULL,' Chris Buckley and Chris Horton','2019-01-01',1546300800000,'<p>BEIJING — China’s president, Xi Jinping, warned Taiwan that unification must be the ultimate goal of any talks over its future and that efforts to assert full independence could be met by armed force, laying out an unyielding position on Wednesday in his first major speech about the contested island democracy.</p><p>Mr. Xi outlined his stance one day after Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, urged China to peacefully settle disputes over the island, whose 23 million people, she said, want to preserve their self-rule. But Beijing treats Taiwan as an illegitimate breakaway from Chinese rule, and Mr. Xi said unification was unstoppable as China rose.</p><p>“The country is growing strong, the nation is rejuvenating and unification between the two sides of the strait is the great trend of history,” Mr. Xi told officials, military officers and guests in the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing.</p><p>China would respect the Taiwanese people’s religious and legal freedoms in a unified “one country, two systems” framework, Mr. Xi said. But he warned that the profound political differences between Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, and China, a highly authoritarian government, were no excuse to reject unification.</p><p>“Different systems are not an obstacle to unification, and even less are they an excuse for separatism,” Mr. Xi said. “The private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwanese compatriots will be fully assured.”</p><p>Mr. Xi also accompanied his offer of talks with a warning — one implicitly also aimed at the United States, which provides Taiwan with military equipment and the possibility of support in a crisis.</p><p>“We make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures,” Mr. Xi said in a section of the speech that drew rousing applause. Those options, he said, could be used against “intervention by external forces.”</p><p>The diverging positions staked out by Mr. Xi and Ms. Tsai have brought into focus how the disputed future of Taiwan remains a volatile question that could erupt into crisis, especially if either side misjudges the intentions of the other — or of the United States, a key ally that has strengthened support for Taiwan.</p><p>Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which handles relations with China, said it did not have an immediate comment on Mr. Xi’s speech.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s offer of dialogue appeared unlikely to win over Taiwanese wary of the idea that they could retain autonomy under China’s principle of “one country, two systems,” Yun Sun, a researcher on Chinese policy at the Stimson Center in Washington, said by email after the speech.</p><p>“Xi is correct in that differences in political systems are the root of the problem,” Ms. Sun said. “But ‘one country, two systems’ is unlikely to be the answer the Taiwanese people embrace.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech was a sharp reminder that, even amid many other external disputes, Chinese leaders remain preoccupied with Taiwan, especially their concern that the island could defy their demands and embrace formal independence.</p><p>China is Taiwan’s biggest trade partner, taking over 30 percent of its exports. Many Taiwanese, though, bridle at Beijing using its growing influence to isolate them from international participation, and to press them toward eventually accepting Chinese sovereignty over the island.</p><p>Since coming to power in late 2012, Mr. Xi has warned Taiwan against any shift toward independence and repeatedly met with Taiwanese politicians from the Kuomintang, the party that ruled China before the Communist Party and that now favors closer ties with Beijing. But Mr. Xi’s address was his first major speech as president devoted to Taiwan, said Bonnie S. Glaser, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>“My initial impression is that the speech is a reaffirmation of current policy,” Ms. Glaser said. She also noted that despite Mr. Xi’s renewed call for unification, he did not set a deadline. “It is notable that there is no mention of a timetable or deadline for reunification — it is just a goal,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Xi indicated that China’s multipronged pressure on Taiwan is likely to persist after Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which is wary of moving closer to China, suffered stinging setbacks in local Taiwanese elections in November. The opposition Kuomintang won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities, prompting Ms. Tsai to resign as leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, though she remains Taiwan’s president.</p><p>Chinese state-run media have depicted the election reversals as a vindication of Mr. Xi’s approach to Taiwan: a battery of measures to isolate Taiwan and undercut its international standing since Ms. Tsai won the presidency in 2016.</p><p>Taiwan’s status has been contested by Communist leaders since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated in the revolution retreated to the island. Tensions have resurged since the 1990s, when Taiwan became a democracy and many voters on the island turned to politicians who argue that Taiwan should keep China at a distance, or even assert outright independence.</p><p>Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party has been at the forefront of those independence-leaning views, and after she won power, China quickly cut high-level contacts, arguing that Ms. Tsai had failed to acknowledge that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.</p><p>In the past three years, China has accelerated efforts to peel away countries from the list of those that give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Last spring, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso established ties with China, and in August, El Salvador cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan, leaving 17 nations that maintain their diplomatic allegiance with the island.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech commemorated the 40 years since China laid out a new approach to Taiwan soon after the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing at the start of 1979. But the United States has remained Taiwan’s most important partner, and the Trump administration has bolstered some support, to the consternation of Chinese officials.</p><p>In March, President Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages official government exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. And in June, the United States dedicated a new $250 million unofficial embassy in Taipei.</p><p>On the last day of 2018, Mr. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which tries to counter China’s growing military influence. The section of the law on Taiwan reiterates American commitment “to counter efforts to change the status quo and to support peaceful resolution acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” It also calls on the American president to send high-level officials to Taiwan and to regularly sell arms to the island.</p><p>The United States and China have brushed close to military conflict over Taiwan: in the 1950s and in 1996, when President Bill Clinton dispatched two carrier groups to seas off Taiwan after China fired intimidating missiles ahead of a Taiwanese presidential election.</p><p>The United States dispatched warships to the Taiwan Strait three times last year to show support for Taiwan. That was done under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation last month has left some question about the Americans’ involvement going forward.</p><p>In his speech, Mr. Xi “appears to implicitly make an argument that use of force should be a last resort,” Ms. Glaser said. “Of course, Xi has to leave that option on the table, but he makes clear it is not his preference.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'undefined'),(7,'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/world/asia/xhina-xi-jinping-taiwan.html','NY Times',NULL,'Unification Plan From China Finds Few Takers in Taiwan',NULL,NULL,' Chris Buckley and Chris Horton','2019-01-02',1546387200000,'<p>BEIJING — President Xi Jinping declared on Wednesday that he wants progress on China’s decades-long quest to win control of Taiwan. But his proposal appeared unlikely to win over residents of the self-ruled island, who have seen Hong Kong’s freedoms in rapid retreat under a similar deal.</p><p>Mr. Xi stressed how vital unification with Taiwan is to his vision of Chinese national rejuvenation in his first major speech about the disputed island. The Chinese Communist Party regards Taiwan, a lively democracy, as a historical mistake — a piece of territory that should never have gained autonomy from China. And as an ardent patriot, Mr. Xi finds Taiwan’s separate status especially galling.</p><p>Mr. Xi did not lay down a timetable for absorbing Taiwan, which is something more hawkish voices in Beijing have urged. But as he nears his seventh year as president, he indicated that his patience had limits and that he wanted to bring Taiwan into ever-closer political, economic and cultural orbit around China.</p><p>“That the two sides of the strait are still not fully unified is a wound to the Chinese nation left by history,” Mr. Xi said in his direction-setting speech in the Great Hall of the People. The political divisions between China and Taiwan, he added “cannot be passed on from generation to generation.”</p><p>But even laced with this sense of urgency, Mr. Xi’s recipe for bringing Taiwan closer to absorption into “one China” appeared unlikely to win over many on the island, even after its president, Tsai Ing-wen — openly loathed by Beijing — suffered bruising electoral losses in November.</p><p>On the one hand, Mr. Xi threatened military force if Taiwanese leaders grasped for independence. On the other hand, Mr. Xi said that if Taiwan were to agree to unification, its rights would be ensured by the “one country, two systems” framework that Beijing used in Hong Kong after it returned from British colonial control in 1997.</p><p>But neither the threat nor the promised reward seemed likely to sharply weaken Taiwanese opposition to China’s demands, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University who studies relations between China and Taiwan.</p><p>“Xi Jinping’s approach is to use a bigger stick and to make the carrot sweeter,” he said in a telephone interview. But having seen Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms squeezed by Beijing in recent years, many Taiwanese people were likely to be suspicious of Mr. Xi’s offers, he said.</p><p>Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed legal autonomy since it returned to Chinese sovereignty, and residents of the city still have much wider freedoms than citizens in the rest of China. But publishing, news media and pro-democratic activism in Hong Kong have retreated in recent years, reflecting the growing weight of Chinese political pressures.</p><p>Virtually no section of the electorate in Taiwan would find “one country, two systems” an attractive goal, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain who studies the island’s politics. “Taiwan is not a colony à la Hong Kong, and it has everything to lose and nothing to gain from agreeing to it,” Professor Sullivan said.</p><p>Even so, Mr. Xi had political motives to show that he was working to absorb Taiwan, Professor Sullivan said. “Having unification as a national aspiration is incredibly useful for the Chinese Communist Party, which stakes its legitimacy on economic growth and nationalism,” he said. “The former is becoming more difficult to deliver, and so the latter becomes more important.”</p><p>Few experts believe that Mr. Xi’s speech augured an eruption of conflict over Taiwan. But tensions could rise, especially as his speech jarred so much with comments from Ms. Tsai.</p><p>Taiwan and China have been at loggerheads, sometimes close to full-scale war, since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated by Mao Zedong’s revolutionary armies retreated to the island. But Beijing’s fears that Taiwan could embrace full independence have grown only since the 1990s, when the island moved to democratic elections that brought to life parties that rejected Chinese identity.</p><p>“Tsai and Xi are sticking to their positions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is little reason to expect any improvement in cross-strait ties as a result of these major statements. But there is also little reason to expect a crisis.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech marked 40 years since China set out a new approach to unification with Taiwan soon after the United States shifted diplomatic ties from the Republic of China — the name for the government on the island — to the communist government in Beijing.</p><p>But in a speech on Monday, Ms. Tsai said Taiwan’s 23 million people wanted to maintain their self-rule, and she warned against reading the recent setbacks of her Democratic Progressive Party as a rejection of that principle. In November, the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities.</p><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Tsai promptly rejected “one country, two systems” as a basis for negotiations.</p><p>“Here I must reiterate that Taiwan will never accept ‘one country, two systems,’ ” she told reporters in Taipei, the capital of the island, in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “Democracy is a value and lifestyle cherished by the Taiwanese people.”</p><p>The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected Mr. Xi’s proposal. It said in an emailed comment that the Chinese government had already “gravely wrecked Hong Kong, that window into ‘one country, two systems.’ ”</p><p>Mr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification.</p><p>But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China’s political goals.</p><p>“Compatriots on both sides of the strait are a family,” he said. “With the one-China principle as a bedrock, there are no obstacles to any political party or group on Taiwan interacting with us.”</p><p>The Chinese government was willing to open discussions with politicians and representatives from Taiwan, so long as they opposed independence for the island and accepted Beijing’s formula for “one China,” Mr. Xi said. He also held out greater access to China’s vast and growing economy. China already accounts for over 30 percent of Taiwan’s trade, and the promised links could appeal to some Taiwanese cities looking to speed growth.</p><p>Jason Hsu, a Taiwanese legislator who belongs to the Kuomintang, said Taiwanese voters were not likely to be directly influenced by Chinese overtures but were concerned about economic prosperity.</p><p>“Most Taiwanese voters are in the middle,” he said. “They care more about prosperity and managing the cross-strait relationship.”</p><p>Analysts saw parallels between Mr. Xi’s proposals and the “united front” tactics that the Chinese Communist Party has evolved to divide, tame and co-opt potential opponents in China, Hong Kong and increasingly abroad.</p><p>“Behind the speech there is a clear intention, which is to intensify the united front work, to multiply the connections and bonds of dependence upon mainland China,” said Professor Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. “For someone who lives in Hong Kong, there are a lot of echoes of what’s happened here.”</p><p>Still, Taiwan’s diverse electorate, economy and politics made it much more difficult for China’s divide-and-control approach to succeed there, he said. Ms. Tsai said she would oppose any Chinese efforts to shape Taiwan’s decisions by recruiting support from local politicians and groups.</p><p>“There must not be meddling in the Taiwanese people’s elections through creating divisions and lures,” Ms. Tsai said in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “It must be the government, or a public authority authorized by the government, that sits down for any talks.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/world/03china-taiwan-1-print/merlin_148671144_2ec719ff-6236-43ec-977c-7abf08efcfd3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(10,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/opinion/taiwans-president-caves-in-to-china.html','NY Times',NULL,'Taiwan’s President Caves In to China',NULL,NULL,' Wu’er Kaixi','2015-11-06',1446768000000,'<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The “historic” meeting that is to take place in Singapore on Saturday between the leaders of China and Taiwan is nothing to cheer about. There will be no progress in terms of peace and reconciliation. The world will witness nothing but politics at its most cynical.</p><p>This is to be expected of the president of China, Xi Jinping, who has put the world into a swoon with his economic diplomacy while persecuting dissent and freedom of speech at home, systematically arresting human-rights lawyers and parading a Stalinesque purge of his political enemies as a crackdown on corruption. In this sense, he might even be excused for pretending to make history. It is simply his job, and he is answerable to no one.</p><p>Taiwan’s elected president, Ma Ying-jeou, on the other hand, cannot be excused. Unlike Mr. Xi, he is accountable to the people of Taiwan who elected him.</p><p>Relations between China and Taiwan have been tense since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek lost a civil war to Mao Zedong’s Communist forces and retreated to the island with his troops. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province, while Taiwanese views of the mainland have evolved over the decades. Mr. Ma was elected in 2008 after a campaign calling for more trade and warmer relations with the mainland, but the sense now is that he’s gone too far.</p><p>In the run-up to the 2012 elections that ushered him into his second and last term as president, Mr. Ma said there was “no way” he would meet with the leadership of China. The Taiwanese are rightfully anxious about the economic and military rise of China and have given up on finding any common ground for discussion with China on Beijing’s primary — in fact, only — goal: reunification.</p><p>Why then, just two months ahead of presidential and legislative elections, would Mr. Ma backtrack and agree to dine with the one man who presents the greatest threat to Taiwan’s democratic and open society?</p><p>The answer is simple. Mr. Ma knows that his party, the Kuomintang, or KMT, is very likely to not only lose the presidency on Jan. 16, but also, in a historical first, lose control of Parliament, putting power in the hands of politicians better attuned to voters’ anti-reunification sentiments. Both Mr. Ma and his counterpart in China are desperate to make a last-minute deal that would give the KMT a fighting chance to retain its grip on Taiwan’s legislature.</p><p>It is not wild speculation to conclude that the only circumstances under which the meeting between Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi could possibly have come about is one in which Mr. Xi offers a concession to Taiwan’s departing president in the hope that it leads to continued KMT control of Taiwan.</p><p>If Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi were particularly smart — and recent history provides no guarantee of that — they may have agreed that Mr. Xi will make a grand gesture, such as an offer to withdraw the missiles that currently threaten Taiwan, in return for a continuation of the status quo with movement toward closer relations. The logic would be that a grand gesture like this would resonate with a nervous Taiwan electorate and could even reshape the electoral landscape.</p><p>Alternatively, Mr. Xi might offer Taiwan even closer economic ties and a role in China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which so far has been denied Taiwan. But this would fail and only push the Taiwanese electorate further into the camp of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which holds a strong lead in polls.</p><p>The Taiwanese have increasingly come to see closer economic ties with China as a threat to their political and cultural autonomy. In fact, it has been Mr. Ma’s attempts at economic rapprochement with China that have largely led to disaffection with not only the KMT but the entire political process in Taiwan. This has been a significant factor in the rise of independent parties, student protests and increased identity politics.</p><p>But let us imagine that the two leaders make the smartest of possible moves, and Mr. Xi offers Taiwan a concession — such as removal of the missiles just across the narrow Taiwan Strait — that wins the KMT some of those elusive parliamentary seats.</p><p>It would be a victory for Mr. Xi and for Mr. Ma — particularly if the KMT were able to hold on to Parliament. The presidential duo could package it to the international community as a major stride toward peace and reconciliation. Western columnists would rub their hands in glee and write in adulatory terms of China and Taiwan’s push for peace in a strife-riddled world.</p><p>Nevertheless, the truth will remain that whatever happens on Saturday in Singapore is nothing more than cynical politics — cynical politics that come at a huge cost for Taiwan. The reason: for the first time since the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1949, one of its leaders will have become a broker in Taiwan’s electoral process.</p><p>This is not something that China’s leadership has earned. It is a position the Chinese have bullied their way into. Meanwhile, Mr. Ma has betrayed his voters by joining forces with the greatest threat to their sovereignty — and purely for political gain.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/07/opinion/07kaixi/07kaixi-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(20,'https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/arts/international/a-taiwan-museum-featuring-all-of-asia.html?searchResultPosition=2','NY Times',NULL,'A Taiwan Museum Featuring All of Asia',NULL,NULL,' Chris Horton','2016-10-06',1475712000000,'<p>CHIAYI COUNTY, TAIWAN — Taiwan has a new National Palace Museum. This time around, it is not just about China.</p><p>Reflecting 16 years of political changes and concomitant rising Taiwan identity, the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum opened its doors to the public in September as Taiwan’s new government looks to play down its connections to China while moving toward greater engagement with the rest of Asia.</p><p>Unlike its namesake in Taipei, where Chinese culture takes center stage, the museum, based in the southwestern county of Chiayi, celebrates the interconnectedness and cross-pollination of Asian cultures over the centuries. Current exhibits employ motifs including goods such as textiles, ceramics and tea, as well as references to Buddhism and Islam, to highlight the shared heritage of the world’s most populous continent.</p><p>An 18th-century green embroidered damask coat featuring Ottoman design, Chinese fabric and Russian lining hangs among Javanese sarongs and royal attire from South Asia. A statue of a Maitreya Buddha from Pakistan stands adjacent to a bronze Buddha head from 17th-century Burma. Twelfth-century ceramic arhats from Korea’s Goryeo kingdom look quizzically across a hall at Edo-era tea ware from Japan.</p><p>“It’s a global view of Asia,” said Wang Shih-Sheng, the museum’s chief curator. “Most of our artifacts come from our collection in Taipei, but when planning the project, we decided to look at things from an Asian perspective.”</p><p>The Taipei museum opened in 1965 and was used by Taiwan’s Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek as a source of local legitimacy vis-à-vis Mao’s Communists, the victors of the Chinese civil war. The museum was also employed as a tool for imposing a Chinese identity upon Taiwan residents.</p><p>Along with the Nationalists came more than 600,000 artifacts from the Palace Museum in Beijing, which was founded in 1925, the year after China’s last emperor, Puyi, who had not held the title of emperor since a short-lived restoration to the throne in 1917, was evicted from the Forbidden City. Before his expulsion, it became apparent that he and his court were selling off national treasures to survive.</p><p>Most of the items that survived the difficult voyage to Taiwan were produced by Chinese kingdoms and dynasties or nearby kingdoms, such as Tibet, who paid tribute to and traded with their Chinese neighbors.</p><p>Other items, however, came from further afield. Of little political use to the Nationalists, they took on a new significance after the election of Chen Shui- bian to the presidency of the Republic of China, as Taiwan has been called since 1945.</p><p>Mr. Chen was a member of the Democratic Progress Party, which sits at the center of the “pan-green” political camp in Taiwan’s politics that emphasizes Taiwan’s unique identity and prefers to keep the country self-determined. The party’s rise in the 2000 elections added a new voice to Taiwan’s identity politics in Taipei’s halls of power. By 2003, the idea of a new and very different branch of the National Palace Museum gained traction among pan-greens.</p><p>The man assigned to coordinate across ministries to establish the museum was Lin Sheng-Fong, who was Minister of State at the time and is now an associate professor of architecture at Shih Chien University in Taipei.</p><p>“There was a common belief that the Taipei Palace Museum had a huge collection and only a fraction of it was displayed,” Mr Lin said. “So we could create a second palace museum using the underdisplayed collection.”</p><p>Politicians in the sinocentric “pan-blue” camp that primarily includes the Nationalists were less enthusiastic, as were bureaucrats in the Taipei museum, Mr. Lin said. Deliberations concluded with Chiayi as the museum’s site and “Formosa in the great era of navigation” as its theme, he said.</p><p>A dispute with the initial architect, Antoine Predock, resulted in the stalling of the project. It restarted in 2010 with the involvement of the Taipei architect Kris Yao, who inherited a half-started project that presented several constraints, including an already-constructed shoreline on an artificial lake. Mr. Yao created a new design for the museum inspired by three primary strokes in Chinese calligraphy: one thick, one dry and one watery and smeared.</p><p>“It’s an abstraction of a very basic Chinese art translated into architecture,” Mr. Yao said.</p><p>The portion of the building representing the thick stroke contains the museum’s archive and exhibition area, which require minimal natural light to protect its contents. The dry stroke lets natural light in, and comprises the building’s exoskeleton, lobby and offices. The smeared stroke, embodying penetration, is composed of walking areas and the bridge that leads over the lake.</p><p>Inspired by his love of ancient Chinese bronzes, especially those of the Shang dynasty, Mr. Yao said he had digitized ancient dragon and cloud patterns for the scaly surface of the “thick stroke” portion of the building.</p><p>“It’s not a building, per se, it’s a form,” Mr. Yao said. “It sits on a totally green plain and is black and white.”</p><p>The museum’s prominence on Chiayi’s verdant coastal plain is a striking departure from the Taipei museum, a Chinese-style palace built into the side of a mountain. In his recent book “The Miraculous History of China’s Two Palace Museums,” the journalist Mark O’Neill wrote of Chiang’s demands for the National Palace Museum:</p><p>“The government wanted not only a traditional Chinese design that matched the art pieces inside but also a museum with the most modern conservation systems; it had to protect the pieces from earthquakes, typhoons, humidity, insects and air raids.”</p><p>A visit to the Taipei museum may leave visitors feeling adrift in the vast breadth of China’s geography and history. The Chiayi museum’s handful of exhibition rooms shrink both time and space, using Asia’s historical commercial and cultural exchanges, themselves often inseparable, to weave a regional patchwork that is neither exhaustive, nor exhausting. China’s important influence is not ignored, nor is it central to the museum.</p><p>Using the example of tea — a beverage that spread across ancient Asian trading routes — Ms. Wang expounded upon the shared differences of the museum’s exhibits.</p><p>“You can trace tea culture back to the Tang dynasty,” she said. “After arriving in other parts of Asia, it evolved because of local habits or culture,” with Tibetans adding yak butter or the Japanese grinding it to make matcha.</p><p>With the aim of creating the world’s top pan-Asian museum, Ms. Wang said the National Palace Museum would bring exhibitions in from other Asian collections around the world.</p><p>The ceramics hall, for example, currently displays Imari porcelain wares on loan from the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka. Future exhibitions will bring Japanese national treasures from the Tokyo National Museum and Kyushu National Museum, as well as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, she said.</p><p>Teresa Chiang, a Chiayi native visiting the museum with her parents and four-year-old daughter, said her first visit had left her feeling more connected to other Asian cultures. “At the Taipei museum you can’t enjoy Korean or Japanese culture,” she said. “Here you can see artifacts from all over Asia — I think it’s amazing.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/06/arts/06iht-RARTTAIWANa/06iht-RARTTAIWANa-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(21,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/business/international/taiwan-semiconductor-china-factory-chips.html?searchResultPosition=3','NY Times',NULL,'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to Open Own Plant in China',NULL,NULL,' Paul Mozur','2015-12-07',1449446400000,'<p>As many of its competitors in the chip industry form partnerships in China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said on Monday that it was taking a different route: setting up a new manufacturing plant without help from a local partner.</p><p>The move is designed to protect its technology while playing to a China market brimming with makers of inexpensive smartphones. It is charting a course between keeping complex chip production facilities outside China and licensing technology to Chinese partners.</p><p>In an announcement Monday, Taiwan Semiconductor said it had submitted an application to Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs to invest in an advanced chip production facility in Nanjing, China. The total value of the investment is expected to be about $3 billion, though a spokesman for the company said it expected to save money by using equipment from facilities in Taiwan and capitalizing on Chinese subsidies.</p><p>In a nod to concerns about advanced chip protection technology being leaked to Chinese competitors, Taiwan Semiconductor said in a separate statement that by the time the facility in China is up and running, an advanced operation in Taiwan would be churning out chips a generation more sophisticated.</p><p>The company added that it “comprehensively protects its proprietary information” and, in referring to its fabrication plant, emphasized that it would “have whole ownership of the fab in China, which will help protect our intellectual property rights.”</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor’s approach stands in contrast to some of its rivals and partners in chip making.

Visit the popular Tamsui district and you may catch a glimpse of the company’s gleaming new $22 million home, which opened in April. If you travel on China Airlines, Taiwan’s flagship carrier, you may even fly on the Cloud Gate Liveried Aircraft, adorned with dancers’ likenesses. The airline unveiled it last year, saying the troupe represented the “pinnacle of Taiwan culture.”</p><p>Founded in 1973, Cloud Gate was Taiwan’s first professional dance company. Forty-two years later, it has become a roving, bounding symbol of this island. On Wednesday, it will open the annual Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the United States premiere of a 2013 work, “Rice.” The visit, with performances through Saturday, will be its sixth to the academy, and its first stop on a tour that will include performances in Los Angeles (January) and Washington (February). The company moves on to Paris in the spring.</p><p>Promoting Taiwan’s image abroad is a responsibility that Cloud Gate’s founder, artistic director and chief choreographer, Lin Hwai-Min, 68, does not take lightly.</p><p>“He’s a very public figure,” said Yatin Lin (no relation), a professor of dance studies at Taipei National University of the Arts. “Because of the political situation with mainland China, it’s very difficult for our political leaders to be active abroad, so many people see him as not just an artist but as a kind of cultural ambassador for Taiwan.”</p><p>This month, that commitment was on display as the choreographer marched into the rehearsal theater at the company’s new complex, clad in his signature uniform (black T-shirt, black pants) and brandishing a black backpack and a pack of cigarettes. While he settled at a table facing the stage, the company’s 22 dancers readied themselves for their first full run-through of “Rice” in a month.</p><p>As the music — a compilation of Hakka folk songs, drumming and Western classical music — began, a lone dancer strode out holding a long, quivering rattan stick. In the next 70 minutes, the dancers stamped, leapt and folded and unfolded their bodies in a demonstration of Cloud Gate’s hybrid aesthetic, which combines Western classical dance techniques with Eastern “rounded” movements that draw on martial arts and tai chi. Missing from the run-through was the production’s backdrop, a sumptuous video filmed on location over a cycle of rice cultivation in Chihshang in southeastern Taiwan.</p><p>Mr. Lin sat mostly silent, scribbling notes and only intermittently shouting (“Don’t rush, don’t rush!” and “Breathe!”). After the dancers took their final, choreographed bows, he stood and went through his notes, working with individuals on minor tweaks. The rehearsal had gone well and now the dancers just needed to focus on taking care of their bodies for the coming season, he told them later as they sat around him on the stage, stretching and massaging their muscles with foam rollers.</p><p>Later, in the company’s offices, Mr. Lin talked about the obligations he felt toward the dancers and society.</p><p>“I often remind the dancers that when they are onstage, they are often the only Taiwanese people that a lot of people get to see that are actually labeled as Taiwanese,” he said.</p><p>Much has changed since Mr. Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947. Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang’s National Revolutionary Army fled here in 1949 after losing the civil war to Mao’s Chinese Communists. The Kuomintang ruled Taiwan with an authoritarian hand for decades until 1996, when Taiwanese voters elected their president for the first time. Taiwan has been considered a democracy ever since (and may elect its first female president in January), but the island remains a disputed territory.</p><p>Growing up as the oldest of five children, Mr. Lin nurtured multiple passions, for politics, writing and dance. Only years later, while a student at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, did he decide to pursue choreography. He had spent two summers in New York studying dance at the Martha Graham School, and after completing his degree at Iowa he returned to Taiwan, and soon started Cloud Gate.</p><p>The company’s birth came just two years after what Mr. Lin, like many other Taiwanese, sees as a defining moment in the nation’s recent political history: the 1971 resolution that displaced the government in Taipei as the representative of China at the United Nations in favor of the government in Beijing.</p><p>“When I started the company I said, ‘Composed by Chinese, choreographed by Chinese, danced by Chinese, for a Chinese audience,’ ” said Mr. Lin, whose family has lived in Taiwan for generations. “Then Taiwan was kicked out of the U.N. and all of a sudden I had to figure out who I was.”</p><p>The event inspired “Legacy” (1978), which portrayed the early history of Taiwan. It was followed by such works as “Songs of the Wanderers,” “Moon Water” and the “Cursive” trilogy.</p><p>Reviews of Cloud Gate’s performances in the United States have been mixed. Critics have lauded the company\'s East-meets-West approach, with Anna Kisselgoff writing in The New York Times in 2003 that “Moon Water” was a “work unlike any other.” But Alastair Macaulay of The Times wrote in 2011 that the works were “repetitive” and called “Water Stains on the Wall” “devoid of lightness and humor.”</p><p>As the company’s stature grew, so too did the modern dance scene in Taiwan.</p><p>“Before Cloud Gate, there wasn’t even such thing as a wuzhe,” said Ping Heng, 57, the founder and artistic director of Dance Forum Taipei, using the term for dancer. “Before, people thought dancing was something you could do in school, but it wasn’t something worthy of being a profession. They just called dancers ‘tiaowu de ren,’ ” literally, people who dance.</p><p>Lin Lee-Chen, 65, the founder and artistic director of the Legend Lin Dance Theater in Taipei, said, “The dance scene in Taiwan today is very diverse,” with dance companies “of all sizes and styles.”</p><p>When asked about his possible retirement, Mr. Lin of Cloud Gate was reluctant to comment. But he acknowledged that the company’s new complex, which he said would allow his troupe and other dance and theatrical ventures to perpetuate the “Cloud Gate energy,” would make it easier for him to step away.</p><p>Still, “I don’t want any statues,” he said. “I’m a Buddhist. I think everything is just illusory, especially for dancers.</p><p>“We know that dance happens, but it also vanishes when it happens,” he said. “All we are creating is air.

But Beijing treats Taiwan as an illegitimate breakaway from Chinese rule, and Mr. Xi said unification was unstoppable as China rose.</p><p>“The country is growing strong, the nation is rejuvenating and unification between the two sides of the strait is the great trend of history,” Mr. Xi told officials, military officers and guests in the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing.</p><p>China would respect the Taiwanese people’s religious and legal freedoms in a unified “one country, two systems” framework, Mr. Xi said. But he warned that the profound political differences between Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, and China, a highly authoritarian government, were no excuse to reject unification.</p><p>“Different systems are not an obstacle to unification, and even less are they an excuse for separatism,” Mr. Xi said. “The private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwanese compatriots will be fully assured.”</p><p>Mr. Xi also accompanied his offer of talks with a warning — one implicitly also aimed at the United States, which provides Taiwan with military equipment and the possibility of support in a crisis.</p><p>“We make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures,” Mr. Xi said in a section of the speech that drew rousing applause. Those options, he said, could be used against “intervention by external forces.”</p><p>The diverging positions staked out by Mr. Xi and Ms. Tsai have brought into focus how the disputed future of Taiwan remains a volatile question that could erupt into crisis, especially if either side misjudges the intentions of the other — or of the United States, a key ally that has strengthened support for Taiwan.</p><p>Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which handles relations with China, said it did not have an immediate comment on Mr. Xi’s speech.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s offer of dialogue appeared unlikely to win over Taiwanese wary of the idea that they could retain autonomy under China’s principle of “one country, two systems,” Yun Sun, a researcher on Chinese policy at the Stimson Center in Washington, said by email after the speech.</p><p>“Xi is correct in that differences in political systems are the root of the problem,” Ms. Sun said. “But ‘one country, two systems’ is unlikely to be the answer the Taiwanese people embrace.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech was a sharp reminder that, even amid many other external disputes, Chinese leaders remain preoccupied with Taiwan, especially their concern that the island could defy their demands and embrace formal independence.</p><p>China is Taiwan’s biggest trade partner, taking over 30 percent of its exports. Many Taiwanese, though, bridle at Beijing using its growing influence to isolate them from international participation, and to press them toward eventually accepting Chinese sovereignty over the island.</p><p>Since coming to power in late 2012, Mr. Xi has warned Taiwan against any shift toward independence and repeatedly met with Taiwanese politicians from the Kuomintang, the party that ruled China before the Communist Party and that now favors closer ties with Beijing. But Mr. Xi’s address was his first major speech as president devoted to Taiwan, said Bonnie S. Glaser, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>“My initial impression is that the speech is a reaffirmation of current policy,” Ms. Glaser said. She also noted that despite Mr. Xi’s renewed call for unification, he did not set a deadline. “It is notable that there is no mention of a timetable or deadline for reunification — it is just a goal,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Xi indicated that China’s multipronged pressure on Taiwan is likely to persist after Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which is wary of moving closer to China, suffered stinging setbacks in local Taiwanese elections in November. The opposition Kuomintang won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities, prompting Ms. Tsai to resign as leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, though she remains Taiwan’s president.</p><p>Chinese state-run media have depicted the election reversals as a vindication of Mr. Xi’s approach to Taiwan: a battery of measures to isolate Taiwan and undercut its international standing since Ms. Tsai won the presidency in 2016.</p><p>Taiwan’s status has been contested by Communist leaders since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated in the revolution retreated to the island. Tensions have resurged since the 1990s, when Taiwan became a democracy and many voters on the island turned to politicians who argue that Taiwan should keep China at a distance, or even assert outright independence.</p><p>Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party has been at the forefront of those independence-leaning views, and after she won power, China quickly cut high-level contacts, arguing that Ms. Tsai had failed to acknowledge that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.</p><p>In the past three years, China has accelerated efforts to peel away countries from the list of those that give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Last spring, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso established ties with China, and in August, El Salvador cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan, leaving 17 nations that maintain their diplomatic allegiance with the island.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech commemorated the 40 years since China laid out a new approach to Taiwan soon after the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing at the start of 1979. But the United States has remained Taiwan’s most important partner, and the Trump administration has bolstered some support, to the consternation of Chinese officials.</p><p>In March, President Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages official government exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. And in June, the United States dedicated a new $250 million unofficial embassy in Taipei.</p><p>On the last day of 2018, Mr. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which tries to counter China’s growing military influence. The section of the law on Taiwan reiterates American commitment “to counter efforts to change the status quo and to support peaceful resolution acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” It also calls on the American president to send high-level officials to Taiwan and to regularly sell arms to the island.</p><p>The United States and China have brushed close to military conflict over Taiwan: in the 1950s and in 1996, when President Bill Clinton dispatched two carrier groups to seas off Taiwan after China fired intimidating missiles ahead of a Taiwanese presidential election.</p><p>The United States dispatched warships to the Taiwan Strait three times last year to show support for Taiwan. That was done under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation last month has left some question about the Americans’ involvement going forward.</p><p>In his speech, Mr. Xi “appears to implicitly make an argument that use of force should be a last resort,” Ms. Glaser said. “Of course, Xi has to leave that option on the table, but he makes clear it is not his preference.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'undefined'),(25,'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/world/asia/xhina-xi-jinping-taiwan.html?searchResultPosition=7','NY Times',NULL,'Unification Plan From China Finds Few Takers in Taiwan',NULL,NULL,' Chris Buckley and Chris Horton','2019-01-02',1546387200000,'<p>BEIJING — President Xi Jinping declared on Wednesday that he wants progress on China’s decades-long quest to win control of Taiwan. But his proposal appeared unlikely to win over residents of the self-ruled island, who have seen Hong Kong’s freedoms in rapid retreat under a similar deal.</p><p>Mr. Xi stressed how vital unification with Taiwan is to his vision of Chinese national rejuvenation in his first major speech about the disputed island. The Chinese Communist Party regards Taiwan, a lively democracy, as a historical mistake — a piece of territory that should never have gained autonomy from China. And as an ardent patriot, Mr. Xi finds Taiwan’s separate status especially galling.</p><p>Mr. Xi did not lay down a timetable for absorbing Taiwan, which is something more hawkish voices in Beijing have urged. But as he nears his seventh year as president, he indicated that his patience had limits and that he wanted to bring Taiwan into ever-closer political, economic and cultural orbit around China.</p><p>“That the two sides of the strait are still not fully unified is a wound to the Chinese nation left by history,” Mr. Xi said in his direction-setting speech in the Great Hall of the People. The political divisions between China and Taiwan, he added “cannot be passed on from generation to generation.”</p><p>But even laced with this sense of urgency, Mr. Xi’s recipe for bringing Taiwan closer to absorption into “one China” appeared unlikely to win over many on the island, even after its president, Tsai Ing-wen — openly loathed by Beijing — suffered bruising electoral losses in November.</p><p>On the one hand, Mr. Xi threatened military force if Taiwanese leaders grasped for independence. On the other hand, Mr. Xi said that if Taiwan were to agree to unification, its rights would be ensured by the “one country, two systems” framework that Beijing used in Hong Kong after it returned from British colonial control in 1997.</p><p>But neither the threat nor the promised reward seemed likely to sharply weaken Taiwanese opposition to China’s demands, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University who studies relations between China and Taiwan.</p><p>“Xi Jinping’s approach is to use a bigger stick and to make the carrot sweeter,” he said in a telephone interview. But having seen Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms squeezed by Beijing in recent years, many Taiwanese people were likely to be suspicious of Mr. Xi’s offers, he said.</p><p>Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed legal autonomy since it returned to Chinese sovereignty, and residents of the city still have much wider freedoms than citizens in the rest of China. But publishing, news media and pro-democratic activism in Hong Kong have retreated in recent years, reflecting the growing weight of Chinese political pressures.</p><p>Virtually no section of the electorate in Taiwan would find “one country, two systems” an attractive goal, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain who studies the island’s politics. “Taiwan is not a colony à la Hong Kong, and it has everything to lose and nothing to gain from agreeing to it,” Professor Sullivan said.</p><p>Even so, Mr. Xi had political motives to show that he was working to absorb Taiwan, Professor Sullivan said. “Having unification as a national aspiration is incredibly useful for the Chinese Communist Party, which stakes its legitimacy on economic growth and nationalism,” he said. “The former is becoming more difficult to deliver, and so the latter becomes more important.”</p><p>Few experts believe that Mr. Xi’s speech augured an eruption of conflict over Taiwan. But tensions could rise, especially as his speech jarred so much with comments from Ms. Tsai.</p><p>Taiwan and China have been at loggerheads, sometimes close to full-scale war, since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated by Mao Zedong’s revolutionary armies retreated to the island. But Beijing’s fears that Taiwan could embrace full independence have grown only since the 1990s, when the island moved to democratic elections that brought to life parties that rejected Chinese identity.</p><p>“Tsai and Xi are sticking to their positions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is little reason to expect any improvement in cross-strait ties as a result of these major statements. But there is also little reason to expect a crisis.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech marked 40 years since China set out a new approach to unification with Taiwan soon after the United States shifted diplomatic ties from the Republic of China — the name for the government on the island — to the communist government in Beijing.</p><p>But in a speech on Monday, Ms. Tsai said Taiwan’s 23 million people wanted to maintain their self-rule, and she warned against reading the recent setbacks of her Democratic Progressive Party as a rejection of that principle. In November, the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities.</p><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Tsai promptly rejected “one country, two systems” as a basis for negotiations.</p><p>“Here I must reiterate that Taiwan will never accept ‘one country, two systems,’ ” she told reporters in Taipei, the capital of the island, in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “Democracy is a value and lifestyle cherished by the Taiwanese people.”</p><p>The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected Mr. Xi’s proposal. It said in an emailed comment that the Chinese government had already “gravely wrecked Hong Kong, that window into ‘one country, two systems.’ ”</p><p>Mr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification.</p><p>But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China’s political goals.</p><p>“Compatriots on both sides of the strait are a family,” he said. “With the one-China principle as a bedrock, there are no obstacles to any political party or group on Taiwan interacting with us.”</p><p>The Chinese government was willing to open discussions with politicians and representatives from Taiwan, so long as they opposed independence for the island and accepted Beijing’s formula for “one China,” Mr. Xi said. He also held out greater access to China’s vast and growing economy. China already accounts for over 30 percent of Taiwan’s trade, and the promised links could appeal to some Taiwanese cities looking to speed growth.</p><p>Jason Hsu, a Taiwanese legislator who belongs to the Kuomintang, said Taiwanese voters were not likely to be directly influenced by Chinese overtures but were concerned about economic prosperity.</p><p>“Most Taiwanese voters are in the middle,” he said. “They care more about prosperity and managing the cross-strait relationship.”</p><p>Analysts saw parallels between Mr. Xi’s proposals and the “united front” tactics that the Chinese Communist Party has evolved to divide, tame and co-opt potential opponents in China, Hong Kong and increasingly abroad.</p><p>“Behind the speech there is a clear intention, which is to intensify the united front work, to multiply the connections and bonds of dependence upon mainland China,” said Professor Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. “For someone who lives in Hong Kong, there are a lot of echoes of what’s happened here.”</p><p>Still, Taiwan’s diverse electorate, economy and politics made it much more difficult for China’s divide-and-control approach to succeed there, he said. Ms. Tsai said she would oppose any Chinese efforts to shape Taiwan’s decisions by recruiting support from local politicians and groups.</p><p>“There must not be meddling in the Taiwanese people’s elections through creating divisions and lures,” Ms. Tsai said in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “It must be the government, or a public authority authorized by the government, that sits down for any talks.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/world/03china-taiwan-1-print/merlin_148671144_2ec719ff-6236-43ec-977c-7abf08efcfd3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'),(28,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/opinion/taiwans-president-caves-in-to-china.html?searchResultPosition=10','NY Times',NULL,'Taiwan’s President Caves In to China',NULL,NULL,' Wu’er Kaixi','2015-11-06',1446768000000,'<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The “historic” meeting that is to take place in Singapore on Saturday between the leaders of China and Taiwan is nothing to cheer about. There will be no progress in terms of peace and reconciliation. The world will witness nothing but politics at its most cynical.</p><p>This is to be expected of the president of China, Xi Jinping, who has put the world into a swoon with his economic diplomacy while persecuting dissent and freedom of speech at home, systematically arresting human-rights lawyers and parading a Stalinesque purge of his political enemies as a crackdown on corruption. In this sense, he might even be excused for pretending to make history. It is simply his job, and he is answerable to no one.</p><p>Taiwan’s elected president, Ma Ying-jeou, on the other hand, cannot be excused. Unlike Mr. Xi, he is accountable to the people of Taiwan who elected him.</p><p>Relations between China and Taiwan have been tense since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek lost a civil war to Mao Zedong’s Communist forces and retreated to the island with his troops. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province, while Taiwanese views of the mainland have evolved over the decades. Mr. Ma was elected in 2008 after a campaign calling for more trade and warmer relations with the mainland, but the sense now is that he’s gone too far.</p><p>In the run-up to the 2012 elections that ushered him into his second and last term as president, Mr. Ma said there was “no way” he would meet with the leadership of China. The Taiwanese are rightfully anxious about the economic and military rise of China and have given up on finding any common ground for discussion with China on Beijing’s primary — in fact, only — goal: reunification.</p><p>Why then, just two months ahead of presidential and legislative elections, would Mr. Ma backtrack and agree to dine with the one man who presents the greatest threat to Taiwan’s democratic and open society?</p><p>The answer is simple. Mr. Ma knows that his party, the Kuomintang, or KMT, is very likely to not only lose the presidency on Jan. 16, but also, in a historical first, lose control of Parliament, putting power in the hands of politicians better attuned to voters’ anti-reunification sentiments. Both Mr. Ma and his counterpart in China are desperate to make a last-minute deal that would give the KMT a fighting chance to retain its grip on Taiwan’s legislature.</p><p>It is not wild speculation to conclude that the only circumstances under which the meeting between Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi could possibly have come about is one in which Mr. Xi offers a concession to Taiwan’s departing president in the hope that it leads to continued KMT control of Taiwan.</p><p>If Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi were particularly smart — and recent history provides no guarantee of that — they may have agreed that Mr. Xi will make a grand gesture, such as an offer to withdraw the missiles that currently threaten Taiwan, in return for a continuation of the status quo with movement toward closer relations. The logic would be that a grand gesture like this would resonate with a nervous Taiwan electorate and could even reshape the electoral landscape.</p><p>Alternatively, Mr. Xi might offer Taiwan even closer economic ties and a role in China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which so far has been denied Taiwan. But this would fail and only push the Taiwanese electorate further into the camp of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which holds a strong lead in polls.</p><p>The Taiwanese have increasingly come to see closer economic ties with China as a threat to their political and cultural autonomy. In fact, it has been Mr. Ma’s attempts at economic rapprochement with China that have largely led to disaffection with not only the KMT but the entire political process in Taiwan. This has been a significant factor in the rise of independent parties, student protests and increased identity politics.</p><p>But let us imagine that the two leaders make the smartest of possible moves, and Mr. Xi offers Taiwan a concession — such as removal of the missiles just across the narrow Taiwan Strait — that wins the KMT some of those elusive parliamentary seats.</p><p>It would be a victory for Mr. Xi and for Mr. Ma — particularly if the KMT were able to hold on to Parliament. The presidential duo could package it to the international community as a major stride toward peace and reconciliation. Western columnists would rub their hands in glee and write in adulatory terms of China and Taiwan’s push for peace in a strife-riddled world.</p><p>Nevertheless, the truth will remain that whatever happens on Saturday in Singapore is nothing more than cynical politics — cynical politics that come at a huge cost for Taiwan. The reason: for the first time since the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1949, one of its leaders will have become a broker in Taiwan’s electoral process.</p><p>This is not something that China’s leadership has earned. It is a position the Chinese have bullied their way into. Meanwhile, Mr. Ma has betrayed his voters by joining forces with the greatest threat to their sovereignty — and purely for political gain.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/07/opinion/07kaixi/07kaixi-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale');

In the eyes of Beijing, of course, Taiwan—despite its democratic elections and self-governing status—is part of China.</p><p>Earlier this month, however, the Trump administration gave its tacit approval (paywall) to Taiwan’s request to purchase 60 F-16V fighter jets. A formal request would still need US congressional approval, but the news has already rattled Beijing.</p><p>Addressing the issue on Thursday (March 28), defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said that China “resolutely opposes” such sales to Taiwan and that any words or actions that undermine the one-China policy are “extremely dangerous.”</p><p>On the same day, foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a briefing:</p><p>Before answering the question, he took issue with how a reporter described Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen. “First I need to correct you on the title of Tsai Ing-wen. She is the leader of the Taiwan Region. The so-called title of ‘president’ is never recognized by China.”</p><p>The jets, in reality, wouldn’t do much to change the power equation across the Taiwan Strait, “nor will it eliminate the threat that China poses to forcibly absorb a democratic Taiwan,” Scott Harold, an associate director of Rand Corp.’s Center for Asia Pacific Policy, told Bloomberg (paywall).</p><p>The F-16Vs are advanced for what they are—fourth-generation fighter jets—but China has fifth-generation stealth fighters, such as the J-20, that are deemed rivals to Lockheed Martin’s advanced F-22s and F-35s. Sales of F-35s to Taiwan, which have been ruled out, would be far more of a provocation to China.</p><p>Instead, the sale of the F-16s would be more of a political shock to Beijing. The last time the US sold fighter jets to Taiwan—150 F-16s under the administration of president George H. W. Bush—China suspended military exchanges with the US. How it would respond this time is uncertain, though it’s hard to imagine China starting a conflict over the sale of a few dozen not-so-cutting-edge jets.</p><p>What’s clear, however, is that tension in the Taiwan Strait is increasing. In recent years China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan, including ones involving bombers and fighter jets last year. And earlier today (March 31), Chinese jets crossed a maritime border, a move Taiwan’s defense ministry said “seriously impacted regional safety and stability.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250298138'),(2,'https://qz.com/1580642/google-honors-tragic-adventurous-life-of-taiwanese-female-writer-san-mao/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Google honors the tragic life of an adventurous Taiwanese female writer','null',NULL,'Echo Huang','2019-03-26T10:53:15.000Z',1553597595000,'<p>Today’s Google Doodle celebrates the 76th birthday of San Mao, the Taiwanese writer who inspired generations of Chinese women with her poetic writing and adventurous life abroad.</p><p>San Mao, the pen name of Chen Mao Ping, was born in 1943—one of the most chaotic periods of contemporary China—and moved to Taiwan with her family at the age of five from southwestern Chongqing, then the capital city of the Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist party, before its retreat to Taiwan following its civil war defeat to Communist Party forces. (San Mao changed her birth name to Chen Ping in 1946.)</p><p>She began her travels abroad in her 20s and spent most of her life in places distant from her homeland, eventually visiting 59 countries. Over her life, she published 20 books (link in Chinese) based on her experiences traveling across Europe and Africa, from the 1970s to her death by suicide in 1991. Through this writing, San Mao depicted a life unimaginable for most of her readers, and inspired them to look on life with a different perspective.</p><p>The doodle depicts her as a long-haired woman holding a pen and paper sitting in a desert, perfectly capturing one of the most important times of San Mao’s life in the Spanish Sahara, at the time a colonial area where administrators from Spain lived in uneasy coexistence with nomadic Sahrawi Arabs.</p><p>San Mao wrote about the conflicts and the struggles for Sahrawi’s liberation from colonialism as well as her marriage with José María Quero, a Spanish man she lived with in the Sahara until he died in a diving accident in 1979. She began publishing those stories in 1974 in a major Taiwanese newspaper, and they’ve been translated into different languages, including Dutch, Spanish and Catalan.</p><p>“Her vivid prose, independent spirit, and willingness to travel widely in a search for knowledge inspired many of her readers to retrace her steps,” said Google’s doodle notes.</p><p>She eventually returned to Taiwan. There, she committed suicide in 1991 after a career setback and a cancer scare, according to one account.</p><p>Even though San Mao is no longer with us, her influence has traveled across time as told by the popularity of San Mao’s English name—Echo—which San Mao adopted from the tutor who encouraged her to write and paint.

Most other democracies around the world don’t recognize Taiwan as an independent country, in deference to China, and it is barred from the United Nations. While the United States has recently partnered with Taiwan officials to fight intellectual property theft, this January Chinese president Xi Jinping warned that Beijing could retake the island by force.</p><p>The Kashmir region between India and Pakistan has been disputed for more than 70 years, a legacy of the Partition that accompanied Britain’s withdrawal from India in 1947. Tensions rose in the volatile region in recent weeks, after India conducted a “pre-emptive strike” in Pakistan-controlled territory, and Pakistan captured an Indian fighter pilot. The mostly Muslim residents of the India-administered Kashmir Valley view the national government as an occupying force, and Pakistan officials support their self-government.</p><p>Russia’s neighbors may also be affected. Russia has already called out US “hypocrisy” over sanctions related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, notes Stacie Goddard, a professor of political science at Wellesley College. “In the short run, this is most likely to bolster Russia’s confidence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia,” the breakaway territories that were once part of Georgia, but now supported by Russian military. The deal could also make Russia “less likely to reduce its presence in  the Donbass region of Ukraine,” Goddard said.</p><p>So far there are no signs that the Trump administration is interested in inserting itself into the long-simmering Pakistan-India dispute. However, the US Navy has increased its presence in the Taiwan Strait, most recently on March 24, responding to Beijing’s circling of the island in recent drills. The US’s policy towards Ukraine remains in question under the Trump presidency.</p><p>Trump made the unprecedented Golan Heights decision in a bid to boost prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of national elections April 9. Netanyahu has been charged in several corruption cases, although he still maintains an edge in polls. He applauded as Trump signed the proclamation, while secretary of state Mike Pompeo and vice president Mike Pence looked on:</p><p>Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and the United Nations immediately condemned Trump’s proclamation, and the UN declared Israel’s annexation of the area “null and void.” As president, Trump has pulled the US out of international agreements, including the Paris Climate Accord and the TransPacific Partnership, but the Golan Heights decision is being specifically criticized as breaking international law.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250299178'),(4,'https://qz.com/1374487/taipeis-dragon-tower-provides-alternative-form-of-burial/','QUARTZ',NULL,'In land-scarce Taipei, the True Dragon Tower is a vertical home for the dead','null',NULL,'Isabella Steger','2019-03-13T13:30:23.000Z',1552483823000,'<p>Nestled in the mountains near the northern coastline of Taiwan, just outside of its capital, is a tower that, once full, will house the ashes of 400,000 people. </p><p>At 20 stories tall, the True Dragon Tower is the biggest columbarium in the world. It’s a striking manifestation of two problems plaguing countries all around Asia—a rapidly aging population, and a lack of space for the dead in urban centers. </p><p>That makes death big business in places like Taiwan, an island nation just slightly larger than the state of Maryland. True Dragon Tower is owned by Lung Yen Life Service, a Taiwan-listed company that is the third-largest funeral services operator in the world by market capitalization. After a decade of construction, the tower finally opened for business in 2002. Its soaring height was, in part, a response to the rapidly increasing rate of cremation in Taiwan. In the 1950s (pdf, link in Chinese), the Taiwanese government promoted it instead of ground burials in anticipation of a space crunch in the future, said the spokeswoman for Lung Yen. Well over 90% of people in Taiwan are now cremated, a rate similar to that of other developed places in Asia such as Japan and Hong Kong.</p><p>People over 65 currently account for more than 14% of Taiwan’s population of 23.6 million, fitting the World Health Organization’s definition of an aged society. According to government projections, Taiwan’s population will peak in 2021, and fall below 20 million in 2050. The country already has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and as Taiwan’s fertility rate continues to drop, by 2065, 41.2% of the population could be elderly. The challenges that come with a large elderly population, though, have already begun; the number of deaths in Taiwan averaged over 170,000 people per year in the last two years and is rising every year. Much of Taiwan is mountainous and unsuitable for development, so almost 7 million people are concentrated in Taipei proper and New Taipei City, the municipality surrounding the capital.</p><p>As the competition between the living and the dead intensifies in densely populated cities like Taipei, companies and governments are promoting alternative forms of burial, which the public largely accepts, though sometimes deeply-rooted beliefs about death mean that the public isn’t always quick to adopt them.</p><h2>Flashing Buddhas</h2><p>A space for the afterlife doesn’t come cheap in True Dragon Tower. After all, the building was designed as a “hotel for the dead,” as described by a company spokeswoman. </p><p>A basic individual niche measures about 22 by 25 centimeters (9 by 10 inches) and starts at about NT$200,000 ($6,500). More elaborate niches can cost more than NT$1 million at the top end (excluding the costs of other funereal procedures such as memorial services and burning offerings). For reference, the average monthly wage of a worker in Taiwan in 2018 was about NT$40,000. Sometimes people buy niches for themselves, but more often it’s the deceased’s family that raise the money to pay for the right spot. The fees for a niche reserve the space indefinitely, so families don’t have to worry about raising more to renew a lease of sorts.</p><p>On the outside, the tower is shaped like a white trapezoidal prism and is almost entirely opaque, with a pagoda at its apex. Each floor in the tower has a different theme depending on the customer’s religious belief and aesthetic preference. One floor offers features such as state-of-the-art LED mini Buddha statues (technology that’s been imported from Japan) embedded in each niche door. Others offer more neutral palettes, intended for Christians or atheists. Among the most striking levels is on the 17th floor, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Tadao Ando. It features a space bathed in white marble floors and stacked with porcelain niches to evoke the lightness of a heavenly afterlife. About 8% of True Dragon Tower’s niches are occupied already. </p><p>According to Chinese belief, the spirit lives on in the afterlife, so people want their loved ones to be buried somewhere pleasant. That’s why there’s a park surrounding the tower—it’s part of the hotel experience for the dead. The land—long owned by the family that runs Lung Yen—covers some 55 hectares (136 acres) and overlooks the Taiwan Strait. The park is designed to fulfill the basic feng shui principle that buildings are most auspiciously oriented (paywall) when they face water with mountains to the back. Graves and mausoleums dot the space, catering to Taiwan’s wealthiest individuals and families. There is also a columbarium for animals, reflecting the large amounts of money that Taiwanese are willing to allocate towards their pets as fewer people have children to spend it on.</p><p>Demand is only growing for Lung Yen’s facilities. In the next five to seven years, Ando will build another (more horizontal) columbarium next to True Dragon Tower, complete with gardens brimming with cherry blossom trees. The Japanese architect will also build three other such columbaria and park space around Taiwan.</p><h2>Eco-burials</h2><p>Lung Yen’s offerings are out of reach for the average Taiwanese citizen, many of whom will instead turn to public services, for which a citizen pays a minimal fee to be buried in a public facility. As columbaria become overcrowded—and NIMBYism prevents governments from freely building new facilities to store people’s ashes in dense urban areas—governments around Asia have vigorously promoted alternative forms of burial to tackle the problem of land scarcity.</p><p>Since the 2000s, the Taiwan government, along with some religious institutions, have been offering environmental “eco-burials.” Customers can opt to have a relative’s ashes scattered at sea, or buried in a mound of soil in a bed of flowers or around a tree. Wang Wen-hsiu, an official with Taipei’s mortuary services office, said that some 24,000 people die each year in the capital, and space is running out in Taipei’s three public columbaria. Currently, all ashes must be exhumed from their niches after 50 years unless somebody renews the lease. If no one does, then the government exhumes the ashes and eco-buries them. </p><p>Chinese traditions of ancestral worship and the firm belief that the dead should have an eternal place to rest make the scattering of ashes a hard proposition for most Taiwanese to accept. But it is catching on. In Taipei, about 22% of people chose eco-burials, particularly tree burials, in the first half of 2018 (sea burials are the least popular form of eco-burial in Taiwan). Non-traditional burials have had less success elsewhere, like in Hong Kong where, despite the government’s attempt (paywall) to popularize them, only 13% opted for eco-burials in 2017.</p><h2>Going mainstream</h2><p>There are a few reasons why eco-burials have been so successful in Taiwan. For one, they’re free. The Taipei government will even subsidize people who want to take their relatives’ ashes out of a public columbarium for a green burial, said Wang.</p><p>Another reason is demographics. Wang Chen-ling (no relation to the other Wang), an associate professor in land management at Feng Chia University in Taichung, said as Taiwan’s population ages and its birth rate plummets, people who don’t have dependents are more prone to choosing a hassle-free form of burial that doesn’t require relatives to tend to a grave or perform rites of ancestral worship. Religious groups also had a major effect on bringing the concept into the mainstream in Taiwan, said Wang, particularly after a revered Buddhist master, when he died in 2009, chose for his ashes to be scattered in a garden at the monastery he founded on the outskirts of Taipei. Today, there is even a waiting list (link in Chinese) for tree burials at the monastery.</p><p>But a more fundamental change in the way that Taiwanese think about death is underway. Wang, the city mortuary official, said that successful attempts to “park-ify” eco-burial grounds are also helping to make death less scary and taboo, and more a part of everyday life,and promote green burials in the process.</p><p>Taipei now has two public parks (link in Chinese) that double as graveyards where tree and flower burials take place. People are increasingly hanging out there—the government has even organized music concerts at tree-burial grounds—as a communal way of remembering the dead in place of performing traditional rites at graves or columbaria. In the future, going to one of these parks could be like “going to an art museum,” Wang said.</p><p>Lily Kong, a geographer, wrote in an academic journal (paywall) in 2011 that Taipei was one city that had successfully managed to change the perception of cemeteries in Chinese cultures of being “sites wrapped in unhealthy miasma.” </p><p>As people in land-strapped nations move away from cultural practices that take up too much space, they may find those places become more pleasant to live. Instead of seeking out solemn spaces dedicated to the dead, their descendants may attend a concert or take a walk in the park as a way to remember their ancestors.</p><p>Be sure to download the Quartz Brief app for iOS to explore our 3D model of Dragon Tower in augmented reality.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250298284'),(5,'https://qz.com/india/1569959/tier-2-indias-splurging-on-luxury-boutiques-fashion-jewellery/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Small-town India is splurging on luxury—and here’s what it’s buying','null',NULL,'Aria Thaker','2019-03-11T06:56:27.000Z',1552287387000,'<p>India’s luxury market is getting a boost from the country’s tier II cities.</p><p>High end spending in these towns grew at a rate 30 times greater than in tier I cities between 2013 and 2018, according to an analysis by credit card company American Express.

It was the first time one of her friends had passed away, and she wasn’t sure how to feel. Wang had written a letter to Santa the year before, so she decided to sit down and write another. This time, she shared her feelings.</p><p>“I’m not going to devote this whole card to talking about Christmas and presents,” she wrote in English in an undated letter sent to St. Nick in Rovaniemi, Finland, which bills itself as the “official hometown of Santa Claus.” The town’s post office, which shared the letter, asked Quartz to not publish the full name of the writer to protect her privacy.</p><p>“Yesterday, I found out a girl in my dance class died. How did the girl feel when she learned she had cancer? I hope the girl is happy now. Sometimes, life doesn’t go the way you wish. But you have to stand up and control your own life. Because you’re the only one who has the ability to change it.”</p><p>Wang is among a fast-growing number of people from China who are writing to Santa. The Santa Claus Village’s main post office in the Arctic Circle receives some 500,000 letters annually from across the world, the majority of which are from Greater China, the office says, a region that also includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p><p>Last Christmas, Santa received a record 16,500 letters from mainland China, making up 15% of the approximately 110,000 letters from the region. In 2014, Greater China overtook the United Kingdom, Italy, and Poland for sending the most letters. Santa’s rising popularity, however, is a stark contrast to China’s ongoing war on Christmas.</p><h2>Banned Christmas</h2><p>Chinese enthusiasm for Christmas isn’t necessarily surprising considering the holiday’s commercial appeal, growing Chinese exposure to the West through media and study abroad, and recent efforts by Finland to attract Chinese visitors to Rovaniemi. But the phenomenon also coincides with an intensifying government crackdown on Christianity and Western influences more broadly from NGOs to international-style education.</p><p>Unlike in Hong Kong, Christmas is not an official holiday in mainland China, and has in fact increasingly been banned in various cities in recent years. On Dec. 15, security officials in Langfang, a city in Hebei province, issued a notice prohibiting the display of Christmas materials and spreading of “religious propaganda” in public areas including schools and plazas, according to ChinaAid, a US-based group that advocates for religious freedom. The notice also warned against selling Christmas products and instructed local workers to ensure a “healthy and orderly environment” during the Christmas period.</p><p>Last Christmas, some local governments, Communist Party organizations, and schools also restricted celebrations. One city even said it would fine individuals caught selling or making fake snow, the Financial Times reported (paywall). State-backed Chinese media last year denied a national Christmas crackdown and insisted local bans were for maintaining security. Critics, however, believe that the grounds of maintaining security are little more than a front to restrict what little religious freedoms remain in China.</p><p>This month, China’s Christian churches are witnessing an intensifying attack on their freedom to worship, starting with the detention of more than 100 worshippers attending an unofficial congregation held by the Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu, one of the few house churches that operates in the open. While many were subsequently released and placed under surveillance, the church’s prominent pastor and his wife remain in custody, having been arrested on allegations of “inciting subversion of state power.”</p><p>Chu Yanqing, an underground “family church” leader in Beijing, told Quartz that the crackdown on unofficial congregations has intensified since 2016, and that Christmas continues to be a difficult time. A former member of Shouwang Church, the largest unofficial Protestant congregation in the capital before it was shut in 2011, he recalls holding public Christmas celebrations with over 300 people a decade ago. Such an event would be impossible now, he said, adding that even festivities in official churches are subject to scrutiny.</p><p>“Every Christmas, police will monitor churches. I’ve never heard of anything dangerous happening, but they do it because they’re worried,” he said. Instead of celebrating on Christmas Eve or Christmas day this year, he plans to hold a gathering of fewer than 30 people after the holiday has passed.</p><h2>Christmas without Christ</h2><p>Despite China’s political wariness of Christmas, its commercial potential is unmissable. Secular decorations are ubiquitous in shopping malls, and the holiday is now promoted as a sort of hump-day shopping period between the retail bonanza of Singles’ Day on Nov. 11 and the Lunar New Year. China’s manufacturing sector has also built a $5.6 billion industry around the holiday, churning out fairy lights and other festive goods, Bloomberg reported (paywall). Production in the manufacturing hub of Yiwu alone accounts for 60% of the world’s Christmas decorations.</p><p>Overseas travel has also fueled China’s Christmas frenzy. In 2016, Finnish organizations partnered with Alibaba to launch a campaign promoting tourism to Finland, with the Santa village in Rovaniemi as one of its main attractions. The city was also designated as a “friendship town” of Harbin, the wintry capital of Heilongjiang province. In 2010, Xi, then vice president of China, went to Rovaniemi and posed for photos with Santa during an official visit.</p><p>Statistics from Visit Rovaniemi, which promotes the city as a tourist destination, show that registered overnight stays from Chinese visitors have rapidly increased in the past decade, from 3,300 visits in 2010 to 32,349 last year. Sanna Kärkkäinen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi, said the city set up an account (link in Chinese) for Santa on Chinese social network Weibo, and incorporated the Alipay payment system in 2016 to cater to Chinese tourists.</p><p>In the town’s main post office, letters from China in all shapes and sizes are stacked in a cabinet in the corner. Some are scrawled on colorful stationery and peppered with drawings of classic Christmas icons. Others are carefully written on rice paper in traditional Chinese calligraphy. Many are bilingual.</p><p>Most Chinese children may not be fully aware of Christmas’s religious background nor of China’s complicated relationship to the holiday. Still, the universal values of Christmas—generosity, hope, and gratitude—are what’s driving them to write to St. Nick.</p><p>Growing up in Beijing, Zhang first learned about Santa from elementary school teachers, who stressed he was nothing more than a fictional character of Western culture. Despite this, she became fascinated by the concept of Santa and began admiring the spirit of giving he represents—so much so that when she turned 19 in 2011, she decided to write him a letter.</p><p>“In China, we don’t have Christmas, and family is more important than gifts,” she wrote in both English and Chinese. ”But you know, one small present can mean so much to a child, and bring so much happiness. Although you don’t really exist, kindness does. In my heart, you represent kindness.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250298242'),(7,'https://qz.com/1480126/taiwan-can-legalize-gay-marriage-with-another-law-post-referendum/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s LGBT community will have to settle for equal but different marriage laws','null',NULL,'Isabella Steger','2018-11-30T06:39:41.000Z',1543559981000,'<p>Taiwan’s LGBT community won’t be getting true marriage equality.</p><p>Following the defeat of referendums in support of same-sex marriage last weekend, Taiwan’s ruling party said yesterday (Nov. 29) that gay couples will be allowed to marry (link in Chinese) under the establishment of a separate law, rather than by revising the current law to redefine marriage following the votes.</p><p>Three motions put forward by conservative groups against gay marriage, including one that sought to restrict marriage to between a man and a woman, were all accepted. Opposing referendums submitted by pro-LGBT groups, including one that proposed rewriting the civil code to enshrine true marriage equality, failed. Supporters of same-sex marriage argue that unless the law is changed, gay couples will not be accorded the same benefits and legal protections as heterosexual couples.</p><p>Taiwan’s top court ruled in May 2017 that restricting marriage to a man and a woman was unconstitutional, and that marriage equality must be legalized within two years, either through changing the civil code or the implementation of a separate law. If no legislative action is taken, gay couples would be allowed to register their marriages automatically under existing law. Many felt hopeful Taiwan’s march to becoming the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage would proceed unimpeded, with president Tsai Ing-wen herself voicing support for marriage equality.</p><p>As time went on, however, it became clear that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was not going to take the initiative to follow through with any legislative action, as it tried to maintain popular support in the run-up to crucial local elections, which took place last weekend. That allowed conservative groups to whip up anti-LGBT sentiments in Taiwan—for example through the dissemination of misinformation on social media—and launch referendums in a bid to derail marriage equality. The DPP also suffered heavy losses in the local elections.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan and Gender Equity Education Coalition, umbrella groups promoting LGBT rights, said in a statement to Quartz that any new law allowing same-sex marriage should follow the ruling laid down by the constitutional court and protect the freedom to marry for gay couples, and called on the government to “end the chaos” and family divisions caused by the referendums.</p><p>Chi Jia-wei—a pioneer of gay rights in Taiwan and the plaintiff whose legal challenge brought about the court’s landmark decision—said that (link in Chinese) he would fully support the establishment of a separate law if the government and anti-marriage-equality groups would allow it to accord same-sex couples the same privileges given to heterosexual couples.</p><p>Taiwan’s chief justice Hsu Tzong-li added that (link in Chinese) the marital rights of sexual minorities are protected under Taiwan’s constitution. He noted that just because a separate law might be enacted doesn’t mean the rights of such couples were not equal if the law were designed appropriately.</p><p>This story has been updated with comment from the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan and Gender Equity Education Coalition.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250298307'),(8,'https://qz.com/1474097/taiwan-votes-against-same-sex-marriage-in-referendum/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s vote against same-sex marriage illustrates the problem with referendums','null',NULL,'Nikhil Sonnad','2018-11-25T16:59:02.000Z',1543165142000,'<p>Over the weekend, Taiwanese voters were asked to answer yes or no to this question, as part of a referendum: “Do you agree that Civil Code regulations should restrict marriage to being between a man and a woman?” The “yes” votes won, in a “a bitter blow and a step backwards for human rights in Taiwan,” according to Annie Huang of Amnesty International Taiwan.</p><p>It’s a step back because in 2017, Taiwan’s high court ruled that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples was unconstitutional. More broadly, though, the result is the latest example of how referendums can be deeply undemocratic.</p><p>The high court decision did not legalize same-sex marriage; it only declared that the legislature would have to make marriage equality law within two years. That meant it was up to Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which gained power in 2016, to follow through. It failed to do so.</p><p>That ineptitude provided an opportunity for groups in Taiwan opposed to marriage equality, led by conservative Christians. These groups took advantage of new rules, passed in 2017, that made it easier to hold and pass referendums. Previously in Taiwan, a referendum required signatures from 5% of the electorate in order to be placed on the ballot. That was reduced to 1.5%. And for a ballot measure to pass, it now only needs “yes” votes from 25% of the population, compared to the earlier 50%.</p><p>That is a low bar. Even though Christians make up just 5% of Taiwan’s population, they were able to collect the paltry 280,000 signatures needed to make their referendum happen. Their proposal to define marriage as “between a man and a woman” received over 7 million “yes” votes—more than a counter-referendum endorsing same-sex marriage, but far less than half of Taiwan’s over 18 million registered voters.</p><p>This liberal approach to referendums has backfired on the DPP—a left-leaning party that broadly supports LGBT rights—which originally pushed to relax the rules. When the new rules were announced, the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, called it a “historic moment” in which “people are the masters.”</p><p>But as the DPP has found out, that is far from the reality of referendums.</p><p>One problem with referendums is that they reduce highly complicated matters to a simple yes or no. The most consequential example of our time is, of course, Brexit. Because the European Union is a large, supranational entity, many British voters felt they had lost the ability to exert their political will. But to distill the nation’s entire relationship to its most important ally to a binary choice was short-sighted, and has led to the nightmare of defining what exactly Brexit is, saddening and angering just about everyone along the way.</p><p>The decision on marriage law in Taiwan reveals an even bigger problem with referendums, though: they turn politics into a popularity contest. Democracy is not just about voting, but also pluralism and the protection of minority rights. In deciding to call marriage discrimination unconstitutional, the court was acting to protect those rights for the LGBT community. Plus, given Taiwan’s law that a referendum needs only 25% of voters to say “yes,” it doesn’t even meet the standard of majority rule.</p><p>In 2017, the high court put Taiwan on the world stage as a model for other Asian nations on human rights issues. That reputation looks fragile now. Over the weekend, Tsai stepped down as party leader after the DPP suffered wider losses across the country. There is lots of blame to go around—blame Tsai and the DPP for not putting same-sex marriage into law, blame conservative groups who cannot tolerate ways of life other than their own. But also blame a political institution that puts the “will of the people” before the rights of the person.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250298350'),(9,'https://qz.com/1473960/taiwans-elections-have-given-beijing-much-to-celebrate/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s elections have given Beijing much to celebrate','null',NULL,'Steve Mollman','2018-11-24T21:33:20.000Z',1543095200000,'<p>Local elections in Taiwan went poorly for the ruling party on Saturday (Nov. 24). But in China, Beijing has been given much to celebrate.</p><p>The independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost seven of the 13 cities and counties it currently holds to the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang (KMT). As a sign of how badly things went for the DPP, it lost Kaohsiung, in the south, despite holding it for decades. It also ceded Taichung, Taiwan’s second most populous city. The stinging results prompted Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen to resign as DPP chair Saturday.</p><p>China chalked up another win with voters’ rejection of a proposal  regarding the 2020 Olympics. The measure proposed using the name “Taiwan” when applying to compete in the contest, rather than  “Chinese Taipei.” China prefers the latter name because it considers Taiwan a renegade province, despite decades of democratic self-rule.</p><p>The elections are considered a status check for Tsai, who came to power two years ago at the expense of the KMT. Since assuming office she’s walked a fine line on relations with China, emphasizing Taiwan’s sovereignty while avoiding calls from within her party to move toward declaring formal separation from the mainland.</p><p>During her term, China has stepped up its military intimidation and undertaken various measures to undermine Taiwan’s economy and diplomatic standing.

CoFact volunteers verify the content of messages and the bot then responds back to the Line user.</p><p>One example (link in Chinese) of a message that went “super viral” on Line last year, said Liang, is one titled “Strange! Why do they want to rush to legalize same-sex marriage?” The message, whose source is unknown, claims that Taiwan—which offers universal health-care—will become a magnet for HIV-positive homosexual men, who will flock to the country and marry a Taiwanese man in order to use the health-care system. Because of the high cost of treating HIV/AIDS, the ultimate beneficiaries will be drug companies while taxpayers and the health-care system will suffer, the message goes on to say.</p><p>Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Administration responded to (link in Chinese) these rumors last year, clarifying that the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment in Taiwan was not as high as the figure purported in these messages, and that foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens are not automatically entitled to free health-care as soon as they get married.</p><p>Like many other countries, Taiwan is facing serious problems with the spread of misinformation online—president Tsai Ing-wen even warned that in the run-up to crucial local elections this weekend, people need to be more vigilant about spreading fake news, and accused China of being the source of some of these messages in order to create divisions in Taiwanese society.</p><h2>“Touch, click, select, and forward”</h2><p>The volume of misinformation against Taiwan’s LGBT community has noticeably increased in recent months as the country prepares to vote in a number of referendums relating to the legalization of same-sex marriage, said Benson Lee, spokesman for the organization Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan, an umbrella LGBT group that gathered the 280,000 signatures required to place an issue on the ballot. They’re asking Taiwan’s nearly 20 million voters if they support changing civil law, which currently defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, to allow same-sex unions.</p><p>Other referendums before voters ask if marriage should remain between a man and a woman, as it currently is.</p><p>Lee said that some organizations intentionally create and spread falsehoods, while “panicking and anxious” parents contribute to its spread by being too quick to share it.</p><p>In October, France’s de facto embassy in Taiwan—the island has official ties with less than two dozen nations—had to issue a statement to refute messages spreading around (link in Chinese) Taiwan’s internet that claimed that 200,000 people had protested in France demanding that the country roll back same-sex marriage. The Bureau Français de Taipei said in a Facebook post that there has been no such large-scale protest against gay marriage in the country, and reiterated France’s commitment to equal rights for all regardless of sexual orientation.</p><p>In a talk delivered earlier this year, Wu Ming-hsuan, an activist and member of the g0v tech community in Taiwan, said that a major factor explaining the proliferation of fake news and misinformation in Taiwan was the prominence of closed messaging groups on Line or Facebook, where many people, particularly the elderly—many of whom had never used the internet before—simply “touch, click, select, and forward” messages.</p><p>Line, which is also popular in Southeast Asian nations like Thailand and Indonesia, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on what it’s doing to weed out misinformation in Taiwan. Earlier this year, the platform said it was taking steps like allowing users to report spoof accounts and working with some government authorities to combat misinformation in Thailand.</p><h2>Playing with parental anxieties</h2><p>Saturday’s referendums come after lawmakers did little to implement a May 2017 ruling from Taiwan’s top court that found same-sex marriage to be a constitutional right, ordering that the law be changed by May 2019.</p><p>Conservative groups mobilized against the ruling and now hope to use the plebiscites to stymie the advance of marriage equality. Supporters of same-sex marriage fear that a referendum result that goes the way of the conservative groups could result in the government introducing a watered-down version of marriage that leaves gay couples “equal but different,” through the creation of a same-sex partnership law that gives legal protections inferior to those in heterosexual marriages.</p><p>They hope instead that the government will amend Taiwan’s civil code so that marriage is no longer defined as being between a man and a woman. Just weeks ahead of the vote, tens of thousands gathered for Taiwan’s pride march last month, the biggest in Asia.</p><p>One of the referendum questions submitted by conservative group Happiness of the Next Generation Alliance also seeks to ban references to homosexuality in Taiwan’s gender-inclusive curriculum in elementary and high schools, and some of the misinformation has particularly targeted parents.</p><p>A leaflet from a conservative group that was placed in mailboxes in Taiwan, supplied to Quartz by a member of Taiwan’s LGBT community, said that “based on the meaning of the rainbow flag,” legalizing same-sex marriage would make it legal to have sex with minors under 16. Voting in favor of marriage equality means “paving the way for pedophilia,” said the leaflet, adding that “children are the treasure of the country’s future, what kind of parent would want this to happen?”</p><p>Another video that spread on Facebook in January 2017 shows a group of protesters supporting a mother who said that because of Taiwan’s gender-inclusive, progressive curriculum, her child was taught how to masturbate in class alongside students of the opposite sex. The woman claimed that she was the victim of smearing campaigns by groups supporting marriage equality.</p><p>Geoff, a US-based graduate student in the US in his 30s who only wanted to be identified by his first name, said that his family members in Taiwan have been “forwarding without filtering” messages of misinformation against LGBT people on Line. He said he tried to offer counter information against those messages, but felt like he was fighting a “losing war.” Now, he says, he’s “checked out entirely” from those chat groups.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/wheatxstone/news/quartz/1555250299199'),(11,'https://qz.com/1597501/foxconn-boss-terry-gou-announces-run-for-taiwans-presidency/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s iPhone billionaire is running for president after a goddess appeared in his dreams','null',NULL,'Isabella Steger','2019-04-17T10:12:18.000Z',1555495938000,'<p>A self-made tycoon and political outsider with a penchant for caps is running for president in 2020, and it’s not Donald Trump.</p><p>One of Taiwan’s richest people and Foxconn chairman, Terry Gou, who made his fortune supplying components to tech companies such as Apple and Sony, announced today (April 17) that he will throw his hat in the ring (paywall) for the island’s presidential race next year.

Gou was born in Taiwan, after his parents came over from China after the civil war.</p><p>Gou was among the first wave of Taiwanese companies that shifted production to China in the late 1980s as it embarked on economic reforms, and built up a massive electronics-manufacturing empire there. Foxconn, or Hon Hai as it’s officially known, has also drawn scrutiny in recent years after the company’s poor treatment of workers was cited as a cause of a spate of suicides at its factories in China.</p><p>Gou’s decision to run for president in January’s elections, along with the meteoric rise of the KMT’s Han Kuo-yu, the populist, pro-China mayor of Taiwan’s second city Kaohsiung, should have the ruling party deeply worried. The DPP recently suffered heavy losses across the country in local elections in November that gave China reason to celebrate as Beijing would rather have the KMT, which stresses close economic ties with China and eschews independence talk, in power. As a businessman with deep economic ties to China, Gou also undoubtedly has cultivated important political relationships (paywall) there.</p><p>Kaohsiung mayor Han has not announced his presidential bid yet, although a growing number of his supporters are calling for him to run. Another populist figure, Taipei’s independent mayor Ko Wen-je—recently known for releasing an earnest rap video—is also widely expected to add his name to the race. The race to Taiwan’s presidency in 2020 is shaping up to be every bit as interesting as the one to the White House.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RTX6S1X0-e1555492798205.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=410&h=269');

Beijing’s malign influence is apparent everywhere, while the United States is seen as largely absent. Washington must wake up to the danger of China’s massive effort to infiltrate, undermine and eventually abolish Taiwan’s democracy.</p><p>Tsai called for Washington’s help to confront Beijing’s comprehensive campaign to exert control over Taiwanese politics and society, which is steadily eroding a 40-year status quo that has kept a shaky peace. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which governs the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, stipulates that the United States will “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.”</p><p>In 2019, those words ring hollow. Xi Jinping’s government brazenly uses economic and political pressure to interfere in Taiwan — an attempt to turn the Taiwanese people and their leaders toward Beijing and against the West. Xi himself smashed the status quo in January when he publicly called for Taiwan to rejoin China under the “One Country, Two Systems” model. One look at Hong Kong should be enough for any Taiwanese citizen to realize that means a steady erosion of their freedoms and sovereignty.</p><p>During interviews with Taiwanese politicians, officials and national security experts, our delegation in Taiwan, organized by the East West Center, heard grave warnings. Following its successful interference effort in last November’s local elections, Beijing is now focused intensely on ousting Tsai and her Democratic People’s Party in next January’s presidential contest.</p><p>“Next year’s election might be the last meaningful election in Taiwan. After that, it will be a Hong Kong-style election,” said Chen Ming-Chi, deputy minister of the Mainland Affairs Council. If China succeeds in returning the Beijing-sympathetic Nationalist Party (KMT) to power, that could be the tipping point after which Taiwan can never again exert its own sovereignty, he said. “2020 would be the beginning of the reunification.”</p><p>In other words, a Chinese military invasion is no longer the scenario Taiwanese fear most. China’s strategy to take over Taiwan is focused now on the hybrid warfare tactics authoritarian regimes increasingly deploy in free societies. Pro-Beijing interests have bought up a huge portion of Taiwanese media and coordinate with Beijing to spread propaganda and fake news and manipulate social media.</p><p>The Chinese government uses economic coercion to both recruit and punish Taiwanese leaders. Meanwhile, China is working overtime to strip Taiwan of its diplomatic allies and keep it out of multilateral institutions. Beijing is literally trying to erase the country from the map.</p><p>Taiwan is the testing ground for these methods, but China is now exporting them to other places, including the United States. That’s a threat not just to Taiwan but also to democracies worldwide, said Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien.</p><p>“Taiwan is only the beginning,” he said. “They want their new civilization to become a new global order. That’s what they are thinking. And together with an expansion of their physical power, now they are putting their dreams into reality.”</p><p>Several KMT officials and former officials told our delegation fears of China were overblown and seeking accommodation with Beijing was the only reasonable approach. Former deputy foreign minister Bruce Linghu said the KMT is not “pro-China” but rather “pro-peace.”</p><p>“Taiwan has to play it smart,” he said. “Why should we be provocative with China?”</p><p>KMT officials insist they support the U.S.-China relationship and are not trying to appease Beijing. But actions speak louder than words. While Tsai was speaking to Americans, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, a rising KMT leader and presidential prospect, was holding controversial meetings with Chinese Communist Party officials in Hong Kong and Macau. It’s clear which relationship the KMT prioritizes.</p><p>The U.S. interest in helping the current Taiwanese government defend its democracy from Chinese interference and aggression is understood — but our will is under question. The Trump administration, despite being full of pro-Taiwan officials, has been inconsistent. There’s progress on arms sales but no progress on what Tsai wants most, a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement. There’s not enough U.S. support for Taiwan’s fight against China’s hybrid warfare approach.</p><p>In reality, accommodation with Beijing likely won’t work and China’s appetite in Taiwan will only grow with the eating. Taiwan proves that democracy and Chinese culture can work together and that prosperity need not require repression. This is an example that Beijing, for obvious reasons, cannot tolerate. Taiwan’s very existence plays into the Chinese Communist Party’s deep insecurity.</p><p>But time is running out fast for the United States to show the Taiwanese people they have international support for refusing to acquiesce to Beijing’s dominance over their politics, economy and society.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iKiT6jz4mTtc72W7Q5JpareHIFs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56HRNICRSII6TCFB5U2G6DWJJ4.jpg'),(4,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/taiwans-tsai-confirms-request-to-buy-new-us-fighters-tanks/2019/03/28/f0af9308-510f-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Taiwan’s Tsai confirms request to buy new US fighters, tanks',NULL,NULL,'Christopher Bodeen | AP','1553768547000',1553768547000,'<p>BEIJING — Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said her government has asked to purchase advanced new fighter jets and tanks from the U.S., a request that if approved, could set off new tensions between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Beijing considers self-governing Taiwan part of China, to be annexed by force if necessary.

The F-16V is the most advanced version of the plane that already forms the backbone of Taiwan’s air forces, while the M1 Abrams would mark a significant upgrade from the aging, refurbished models the army now uses. Reports say Taiwan is seeking 66 of the planes.</p><p>In Beijing, defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian reiterated Thursday that China was “firmly opposed” to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and military exchanges between the sides.</p><p>While China will strive to unify with Taiwan by peaceful means, it is prepared to take “all necessary measures” in response to pro-independence sentiment and outside influence, Wu said.</p><p>Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China urges the U.S. to stop arms sales to Taiwan “to avoid serious damage to China-U.S. cooperation.” He added that the U.S. should “recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm” of the issue. The comments came the same afternoon that U.S. trade negotiators arrived in Beijing for a new round of talks.</p><p>In addition to arms sales, the U.S. is bound by law to treat threats to Taiwan as matters of major concern — although the law is vague on how it would respond to a Chinese attack on the island.</p><p>Taiwan’s arms requests are carefully reviewed to ensure they suit “Taiwan’s actual needs,” Tsai said.</p><p>“We are also investing heavily into training as well as modernizing our defense strategies to prioritize the use of asymmetrical capabilities, so that they more closely correspond with the realities of the threat we face,” Tsai said. “Altogether, I hope that these actions will ensure that the people of Taiwan remain able to choose our own futures, free of coercion.”</p><p>Tsai, who says she will seek a second four-year term next year, said Taiwan was also stepping-up training as it prepared to transition to an all-volunteer force and pointed to three consecutive years of defense budget increases.</p><p>“These funds have been directed into programs that will make a real difference in Taiwan’s defense, including asymmetrical capabilities,” she said.</p><p>Tsai’s unofficial Hawaii visit comes at the end of a trip to the Pacific island nations of Palau, Nauru, and the Marshall Islands, three of Taiwan’s dwindling number of allies that now total just 17 as Beijing seeks to increase Taiwan’s international isolation.

It has also stepped up efforts at military intimidation, such as circling the island with bombers and fighters in what are officially termed training missions.</p><p>Elsewhere in remarks carried by satellite link to the conservative Washington think tank the Heritage Foundation, Tsai said she found developments in Hong Kong “deeply concerning.” China has touted Hong Kong as a future model Taiwan under what it calls “one country, two systems.”</p><p>Critics say the semi-autonomous territory’s civil liberties have been gradually eroded since it was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.</p><p>“Hong Kong is a reminder that all politicians in Taiwan, regardless of politically parties, should carefully avoid falling into a trap laid by China, which includes economic incentives and other promises but ultimately leads to the same destination that is one country two system,” Tsai said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalist Johnson Lai contributed to this report from Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Well, sort of. It has a constitution, an army and an elected government, and yet the United Nations doesn’t recognize it. The reason? Taiwan became the home base of Chinese who fled Communism in the 1940s, and China considers the island one of its provinces, the government as illegitimate and any talk of independence as deeply hostile. China blasted missiles into the waters surrounding Taiwan in the mid-1990s as a warning not to go it alone. Relations and trade links have strengthened since then, but Taiwan’s first female president, leader of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, has come to power at a time when China is growing more assertive.</p><p>The Situation</p><p>Elected in a landslide in 2016, President Tsai Ing-wen pledged peaceful ties with China even as she resisted pressure from the mainland to support the “one-China principle” — the understanding that both sides belong to one China, even if they have different ideas about what that means. The Beijing government considers itself the rightful ruler of Taiwan, even though the island has been governed separately since 1949. In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested that groups and individuals in mainland China and Taiwan who support the “one China” framework enter into “in-depth democratic consultations” and work toward unification  — the clearest sign yet that he wants the 70-year dispute settled during his tenure. His comments came a day after Tsai warned against continued threats from China. Taiwan under Tsai — whose party supports achieving full independence — has pursued closer ties with the U.S., including the resumption of high-level U.S. official visits to Taiwan, which President Donald Trump signed into law.  In March, the Trump administration indicated it may sell fighter jets to Taiwan, a move that would incense China. Xi has warned that efforts to widen divisions with Taiwan would be “punished by history” and that his country had the capabilities to stop any attempt at independence. China has picked off Taiwan’s few remaining allies, launched regular “encirclement patrols” with military jets around Taiwan’s airspace and pressured international airlines into listing Taiwan as part of China. Tsai’s party suffered heavy losses in local elections to the China-friendly opposition in November, raising questions about her prospects in the general election in January 2020. </p><p>The Background</p><p>Victory by the Communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949 forced the nationalist Kuomintang government to flee the mainland and cross the 110-mile Taiwan Strait along with more than 1.5 million refugees. Staunch U.S. support mellowed in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon shifted America’s diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in an effort to contain the Soviet Union. Even so, America passed a 1979 law committing to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait and facilitate arms sales to the island democracy. After 38 years of often brutal rule, Taiwan dropped martial law in 1987 and a year later got its first native-born president, who went on to become its first democratically elected leader in 1996. Tensions erupted into Chinese military action twice — in the 1950s then again around a Taiwan election in the mid-1990s. China passed a law in 2005 authorizing an attack if the island declares independence. Even with only a handful of nations recognizing Taiwan, its 23.6 million people have built their economy into a technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Average income is three times greater than that of China. Much of Apple’s iPhone is made by Taiwanese companies, while tech giants including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company lead the world in making computer chips for other firms.</p><p>The Argument</p><p>China aims more than 1,200 missiles at Taiwan and no peace treaty has been signed in the seven decades since the governments split. While many China-watchers say there is too much at stake for military confrontation, especially given the prospect of U.S. involvement and possible economic fallout, Trump’s election has added a degree of uncertainty to old assumptions. China’s actions in Asia’s disputed waters have indicated a more expansionist and aggressive regional stance. Taiwan’s voters, wary of the lack of political freedom in China, turned to Tsai to keep the peace while building international ties — something of a challenge given its neighbor’s influence — with a view to a future less dependent on the mainland. </p><p>To contact the authors of this QuickTake: Debra Mao in Hong Kong at dmao5@bloomberg.netSamson Ellis in Taipei at sellis29@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this QuickTake: Grant Clark at gclark@bloomberg.net</p><p>First published Jan. 10, 2016</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fzXgSDVAyp2Awu6hd2cYmkrEXZs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCUTO6CMLII6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg'),(6,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/rough-straits-in-the-china-taiwan-relationship/2019/03/06/95abcd04-3e78-11e9-85ad-779ef05fd9d8_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Rough straits in the China-Taiwan relationship',NULL,NULL,'Letters to the Editor','1551911613000',1551911613000,'<p>Regarding the Feb. 26 news article “Taiwan’s 2020 election campaign is all about Washington vs. Beijing”:</p><p>The article said Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen may have signaled that Taiwan is “a bulwark against Chinese expansionism” in East Asia.

Ms. Tsai takes a confrontational approach by not recognizing the 1992 consensus between Taipei and Beijing, namely “one China, respective interpretations,” making cross-strait relations rather difficult to manage and harming Taiwan’s economy and diplomatic relations. These issues will likely be hotly debated in the forthcoming presidential campaign. </p><p>Given the fierce competition between the United States and mainland China lately, the people of Taiwan are increasingly worried that Taiwan may be used as a bargaining chip in the process.

(Cheng’s late husband, Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton economist and health-care expert, had been the one to recommend a single-payer system to the country in the 1980s.)</p><p>The country is home to about 24 million people and is the world’s 19th-largest economy; 99.9 percent of its residents are enrolled in the national health-care program, regardless of preexisting conditions.</p><p>“Comprehensive benefits include inpatient and outpatient care, mental health care, prescription drugs, dental care, Chinese medicine, dialysis, and day care for the elderly,” Cheng notes.</p><p>She continues:</p><p>About 6.1 percent of the GDP in Taiwan is spent on health care; in the United States, one of the highest levels of a developed country, it’s about 17 percent.</p><p>In an interview, Cheng gave examples of price disparities between the United States and Taiwan, based on statistics from insurance companies and government agencies.</p><p>Harvoni, a drug to treat hepatitis C, costs $2,132 for a course of treatment in Taiwan; in the United States, the same amount costs an average of $32,114, she said.</p><p>An MRI costs $288 in Taiwan; in the United States, it’s $1,119.</p><p>A C-section costs $1,404 in Taiwan; in the United States, it’s $15,106.</p><p>Interest in Taiwan’s health-care system has been surging in recent years.

Many, many countries that are looking to cover everyone — they are looking to Taiwan’s model as a guide.”</p><p>Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative think tank American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said inflated U.S. health-care costs were in part the result of a “pattern of overutilization of some things like excessive testing and underutilization of preventive care.”</p><p>\"You add it all up, it costs a lot,” he said.</p><p>Holtz-Eakin said a recent study of prices looked at 23 drugs and found they cost 80 percent more in the United States than other places. Still, 11 of those drugs were available in every other country in the study, Holtz-Eakin said.</p><p>“So one of the prices you pay in another country is you don’t get access to some diagnoses and therapies,” he said. “It’s hard to put a price tag on that.”</p><p>[An 11-year-old pleaded for an abortion after she was raped.

He told an audience Tuesday night that he praised China’s President Xi Jinping by calling him the “king” of China to his face.</p><p>“He said, \'But I am not king, I am president.’ I said ‘No, you’re president for life, and therefore you’re king,’ ” Trump recounted from his 2017 trip to Beijing. “He said, huh. He liked that. I get along with him great.”</p><p>The way Trump tells the story, he seems envious that the Chinese government changed its constitution in March 2018 to remove term limits for presidents, essentially allowing Xi to stay on as the head of the Chinese government in perpetuity.</p><p>But China’s steady slide toward totalitarian rule is the exact opposite of what’s in the interests of the United States and the world, not to mention the Chinese people. The concentration of power by Xi and his cohorts goes hand in hand with the Chinese Communist Party’s rising internal repression and external aggression.</p><p>On a journalism fellowship last week in Taiwan — the only Chinese-speaking democracy on earth — our delegation asked Foreign Minister Joseph Wu what would happen if China were to become a democracy instead of a dictatorship.</p><p>“If we think about the possibility that China is going to change itself into a democracy, I think it’s a blessing for the rest of the world,” Wu said.</p><p>A democratic China would be more focused on its own internal development than on expansionism, Wu argued. For Taiwan — which is on the front lines of China’s economic, political and diplomatic aggression — a democratic China would be less threatening and less intent on convincing Chinese people and the world that Taiwan is a territory they need to recover.</p><p>“And for the Taiwanese people’s reaction to China becoming a democracy, we would congratulate the Chinese people that they will be able to enjoy the same degree of freedom and human rights protection as Taiwan,” Wu said. “That’s a good thing for them.”</p><p>Wu was answering a question about a hypothetical situation; nobody thinks democracy in China is going to break out any time soon. June will mark the 30th anniversary of the Chinese government’s 1989 massacre of thousands of pro-democracy advocates in Tiananmen Square, and the CCP has kept its foot on the neck of the movement ever since.</p><p>But Taiwan’s situation should be a warning to the rest of the world that China’s intention is to undermine and eventually erode democracy and the values it represents, Wu said.</p><p>“Taiwan’s democracy is something that we need to treasure, and China’s intention is to destroy Taiwan’s democracy,” he said. “We have to prevail, because we have to show the international community that democracy is a better path for mankind.”</p><p>Of course, official U.S. foreign policy is to support Taiwan’s democracy and push for political reform in China. “Taiwan is a democratic success story, a reliable partner and a force for good in the world,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in February.</p><p>But Trump’s praise of Xi’s power grab undermines that message. Wu said that it’s in the nature of authoritarian regimes to be externally aggressive and internally repressive, attacking all freedoms, including religion.</p><p>“Look at their suppression of the Catholics,” he said. “It is because the churches [are] the best way of organizing the public, and the Chinese government is very fearful of that.”</p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien told our delegation that China’s increasing authoritarianism is not just a problem for China and Taiwan, but for all democracies. Beijing is increasingly exporting its repression to free societies, including by attempting to force Western corporations such as airlines to erase the word “Taiwan” from their websites.</p><p>“Changing the name of Taiwan is not only about Taiwan, it’s about bending democracies’ will,” Hsu said. “I think everyone in democracies around the world should wake up to that.”</p><p>No one is advocating for regime change policies in China, but the Chinese people’s demands for greater freedoms are not going away, either. As the famous Chinese democracy activist Wei Jingsheng wrote in “The Fifth Modernization,” a 1978 document that cost him 18 years in prison and permanent exile:</p><p>“People should have democracy. When they ask for democracy, they are only demanding what is rightfully theirs. Anyone refusing to give it to them is a shameless bandit no better than a capitalist who robs workers of their money earned with their sweat and blood. Do the people have democracy now? No. Do they want to be masters of their own destiny? Definitely yes.”</p><p>Trump will never be a champion of democracy. But the least he could do is avoid praising Xi for grabbing power and then bragging about that to a group of donors.

Hard-line Chinese analysts have issued a report advocating that Beijing take a page from American policy in Venezuela and recognize as Taiwan’s next president any candidate who supports unification. In Taiwan, a group of uncompromising independence activists are lobbying their government to “create [an] independent state and advance towards being a normal country” next year. Beijing has warned that any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan would result in war.</p><p>These maneuvers are occurring against a backdrop of a deteriorating relationship between the Trump administration and Beijing, and as China’s president, Xi Jinping, seems anxious for movement on Taiwan.</p><p>Beijing has always claimed that Taiwan is part of China and has never dropped its threat to use force to “unite the motherland.” For its part, the United States’ one-China policy acknowledges Beijing’s position that there is only one China, but Washington has never taken a position on whether Taiwan belongs to the People’s Republic of China. What’s more, under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed in 1979, the United States is legally obligated to provide for Taiwan’s defense.</p><p>For decades, Chinese officials privately argued that with time and Chinese economic growth Taiwan would have no choice but to accept China’s embrace. Now Chinese analysts are far more pessimistic. First, there had been an assumption in some circles that China’s political system would evolve into a more liberal one, making a confederation with China a palpable option for many on Taiwan. But instead, China today is more repressive than at any time since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests around Tiananmen Square.</p><p>Second, many Taiwanese have been turned off by China’s handling of Hong Kong, which they see as a harbinger of things to come in Taiwan should China take control. China absorbed the former British colony in 1997, promising — under the slogan “one country, two systems” — to let it maintain its unique economic system for 50 years and pledging to allow more democracy. Twenty-two years into Chinese rule and Beijing has not significantly expanded democracy in Hong Kong and has begun to meddle openly in the internal affairs of the territory.</p><p>Finally, after almost 30 years of democratization in Taiwan, many Taiwanese have discovered a unique identity and have no interest in unifying with Beijing. In 1992, when democracy just began in Taiwan, only 20 percent of the respondents to an annual poll held by Taiwan’s National Chengchi University called themselves “Taiwanese only.” In 2018, more than 50 percent did so. And those who identified solely as Chinese dropped from a quarter of those asked in 1992 to less than 3 percent last year.</p><p>Faced with these trends, Xi has apparently decided that saber rattling is better than a soft touch. On Jan. 2, in his first major speech on Taiwan since taking over the leadership of the Communist Party in 2012, he warned that the Taiwan “problem” could not be put off for another generation and threatened the island with attack. He also demanded that any talks between Taiwan and China must be carried out with both sides acknowledging that the ultimate goal would be unification. Xi’s speech prompted a rarely seen show of political unity in Taiwan. Both President Tsai, who represents the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, and the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, rejected Xi’s demands.</p><p>Xi’s tougher line has garnered support among hard-liners in China. In a report given to me by a prominent hard-liner who requested anonymity, one group suggested somewhat implausibly that should China decide to attack Taiwan, it could persuade Russia, North Korea and Iran to join the fight. The report also advocated launching an economic embargo on Taiwan by first drawing up a list of Taiwanese independence supporters and blocking them from doing business in China.</p><p>The Financial Times recently reported that officials from China’s Taiwan Affairs Council have been calling in mainland-based Taiwanese business executives and Taiwanese students for discussions on Taiwan’s fate. Taiwanese who participated in these sessions described them as a way to gauge the political reliability of Taiwanese living in China. The hard-liners’ report called on the Chinese government to find a leader on Taiwan willing to accept Chinese rule recognize him or her, as the United States has with Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó.</p><p>This type of extremism has echoes in Taiwan, where independence activists are chafing at Tsai’s moderate stance. Following defeats for the Democratic Progressive Party in local elections in November, independence advocates, led by Kuo Pei-hung, chairman of pro-independence Formosa TV, established an organization called the Formosa Alliance to push independence and organize a referendum on the topic.</p><p>Back in Washington, support for Taiwan is at its highest since the passing of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. Former diplomat Richard C. Bush, now at the Brookings Institution, predicted that inviting Taiwan’s president to Congress would inflame Beijing. Others are less alarmed.</p><p>Regardless, Taiwan, which has lain dormant for years as an issue between the United States and China, is back.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rSl5Z_4dZHeDCEjo9WkWo4klHXQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWKMMKBIW4I6TEDOTVK3MRI6WQ.jpg'),(11,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/recent-developments-surrounding-the-south-china-sea/2019/04/01/3a9cc018-544d-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Recent developments surrounding the South China Sea',NULL,NULL,'Christopher Bodeen | AP','1554102629000',1554102629000,'<p>BEIJING — A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:</p><p>___</p><p>EDITOR’S NOTE: This is a weekly look at developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts in the region.</p><p>___</p><p>TAIWAN PROTESTS CHINESE MILITARY AIRCRAFT CROSSING TAIWAN STRAIT CENTER LINE</p><p>Taiwan says its planes warned off Chinese military aircraft that crossed the center line in the Taiwan Strait, calling China’s move a provocation that seeks to alter the status quo in the waterway dividing the island from mainland China.</p><p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said a pair of Chinese J-11 jet fighters crossed the line around 11 a.m. Sunday and entered the island’s southwestern airspace.

Inventory figures at Apple’s primary chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. were also high at the end of 2018, up 40 percent from a year earlier.</p><p>At the time, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told me that stockpiles consisted primarily of raw wafers and 7-nanometer chips in production. In layman’s terms: the basic ingredient upon which chips are built, and semiconductors made with the latest technology. In the fourth quarter, Apple was the primary client for such technology.</p><p>That revelation came soon after Apple cut its own outlook for the period, citing weaker demand. Impressively, the iPhone maker managed its inventory so well that the figure climbed a mere 12.8 percent at the end of December from a year earlier – one of the slowest clips in recent quarters, and in the face of falling sales.</p><p>My conclusion in January was that, to avoid holding inventory, Apple was pushing it back onto suppliers. Ho declined to name the client, but she said that customers may ask TSMC to keep product on its shelves (and books) even if a chip has finished production and passed all required tests.</p><p>Foxconn’s major subsidiary, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., takes a long time to report its financials, which is why we didn’t get to view its year-end numbers until now. Maybe this delay diminishes the usefulness of this data, or the situation has improved during the interceding first quarter.</p><p>Nevertheless, these Hon Hai figures are further evidence of Apple’s inventory strategy.</p><p>The Chinese government also looks to be inadvertently helping Apple trim its stockpiles. In March Beijing announced it would cut the value-added tax rate to help buoy the economy. Apple started passing those savings on to consumers, Caixing reported, citing data from e-commerce companies and Apple’s own China website. The company already lowered prices in February, but the levy cut allowed it to trim again with a minimal hit to margins.</p><p>Over the past few months, suppliers throughout the hardware sector have spoken of moves to lower output in order to digest excess inventory. The result will be a particularly deep trough for the March-quarter cyclical low season.</p><p>If Hon Hai’s figures are anything to go by, the first quarter is likely to be one of austerity, in the hope that taking one for Team Apple will be rewarded with a rebound later.

He is due to attend a “Belt and Road” forum in Beijing with other foreign leaders this month, according to the Chinese government.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign initiative, Belt and Road is building railways, ports, power plants and other projects in dozens of countries around the globe.

It’s worth knowing, and growing, these others.',NULL,NULL,'Adrian Higgins','1554331756000',1554331756000,'<p>The Japanese flowering cherry trees now in serene flower around the Tidal Basin are, for the most part, clones of a single plant favored in 19th-century Tokyo and named Somei-Yoshino.</p><p>It is easy to see their appeal; the blossoms each consist of a simple, creamy collar of silken petals around a yellow stamen. They seem pure and natural, even if they are the end product of centuries of hybridizing in Japan.</p><p>The tree canopies spread agreeably with age, and by blooming in unison (as clones) they create an enchanting blush-white cloud that floats above the water. When they are done, they fall in an extended shower of confetti that is nothing short of magical.</p><p>This monocultural artistic effect comes with some risk: If you plant the genetically identical plant en masse, you are raising the risk of it being wiped out by a new pest or disease. But that view is probably too dire; on paper cherry trees are beset with all manner of pernicious maladies, and yet they survive. The biggest threat to the Potomac Park cherry trees is us; all those feet squash the life out of the soil and the roots.</p><p>The short-lived blossoms are viewed in their native land as a symbol of the fleeting nature of our lives. The challenge of the Tidal Basin Yoshinos is in trying to meditate on this profundity in the company of thousands of other cherry-peepers. Many are, no doubt, sensitive types seeking a soulful experience, but others lack introspective sensibilities, and some believe an experience is only real if it is seen through the veil of a smartphone.</p><p>On balance, the hordes are all to the good. The greater the number of people connecting to nature, the better the prospects for the planet, I say.</p><p>And it is not just in Washington where mass plantings of trees produce appreciative crowds. In her new book, “The Sakura Obsession,” Naoko Abe recounts the ritual of cherry-viewing or hanami. Her journalist colleagues in Tokyo would send an assistant to stake out a spot under the trees in the afternoon, and by the evening, they had joined him for a raucous, sake-fueled celebration. Across the land, millions do the same.</p><p>From a gardener’s perspective, the surfeit of Yoshinos means we may be missing out on all the other Japanese flowering cherry tree selections, hybrids and varieties that are waiting to please us. Some of these cherries, I point out, are inferior to Yoshino. The weeping ones grafted high on a cherry stick live up to their name. When I see one, I want to weep.</p><p>More than 10 percent of the trees in Potomac Park are of the mid-April flowering Kwanzan or Kanzan cherry, which to my mind is a dud: too coarse in structure, too blowzy in its double flower, too strong in color. The flower effect is diluted by the burgeoning foliage. If the Yoshino draws us to the Elysian fields, the Kwanzan barks the penny arcade.</p><p>If I were to plant a cherry tree, I might pick Accolade, a hybrid between the Sargent and Higan cherry that is vigorous and yet delicate in its blushed, semi-double blossoms.</p><p>Dream Catcher is more upright in habit than Yoshino (useful for small urban gardens) and as a seedling selection of the Okame cherry blooms earlier, as well.</p><p>Helen Taft, named after the first lady behind the Tidal Basin plantings, is a cross between the Yoshino and Taiwan cherries. It blooms at the very threshold of spring and is smothered in pale pink single blossoms that darken after a few days.</p><p>First Lady, another in the series, is strongly upright with dark glossy leaves and abundant dark rose-pink blooms redolent of the Taiwan cherry. This hybrid, which grows to 27 feet high and 14 feet across after 20 years, has proven the most popular, Pooler says.</p><p>The reliance on Yoshino is understandable, given its grace, and it has mesmerized not just Washington. In major public plantings in postwar Japan, the Yoshino became predominant. Abe is not entirely happy with this. In her book she points out that some 400 varieties of cherry have been bred from a handful of species over the past 1,200 years. Most of the world knew nothing of these beauties until Japan opened to the West in the mid-19th century. Suddenly confronted with these treasures, cities such as Washington naturally went crazy for them.</p><p>She recounts almost 50 cherry varieties. Her beef isn’t with Yoshinos, per se, but the fact that a militarized Japan in the 1920s and 1930s co-opted the plant as a symbol of noble death in the service of a belligerent state. On the eve of their mission, kamikaze pilots would get together and sing “Doki no Sakura” — Cherry Blossom Brothers.</p><p>But the book’s main and happier thrust is the recognition of an English plantsman — Collingwood Ingram — who became a noted guardian of the Japanese flowering cherry from his garden in Kent. He introduced some 50 varieties to the West and bred the Okame cherry tree, favored for its upright habit and early flowering. Perhaps his greatest feat was in preserving the Great White cherry and returning it to Japan, where it was known as Taihaku and then lost to cultivation. It is noted for its large, single white blossoms.</p><p>His initial efforts to send scions to Japan failed — they arrived dried out and dead. But he sent another batch embedded in potatoes, and they survived. There you have it, an Englishman using a South American tuber to restore an ancient Asian cherry to its homeland. That has to be a message about the power of the cherry tree to bring people together. The same cherry blossom dance is afoot, joyfully, this week on the banks of the Potomac.</p><p>@adrian_higgins on Twitter </p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RXBJ4Q0xr2Rf7lCVzhlMAIg_5K0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D76RVTR7REI6TE3BGAP7WW6V4Y.jpg'),(15,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/26/when-it-comes-negotiating-with-china-devil-is-details/','The Washington Post',NULL,'When it comes to negotiating with China, the devil is in the details',NULL,NULL,'Neil Thomas','1553625124000',1553625124000,'<p>President Trump may soon have himself a deal.</p><p>After years of criticizing China for “ripping us off” with “unfair trade practices,” and after a months-long trade war involving more than $360 billion in two-way tariffs, Trump is optimistic about announcing an economic accord with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit that could happen as early as late April.</p><p>The good news is that Trump’s negotiators appear to have won concessions from China on removing requirements for foreign firms to enter joint ventures with local entities and banning forced technology transfer. They are also moving toward an enforcement mechanism that might finally do something to curb rampant Chinese intellectual-property theft and protectionism that costs U.S. firms an estimated $50 billion a year.</p><p>But much work remains, not least Beijing’s translation of the draft agreement into Chinese, as the two sides have so far operated only in English. Many observers worry that China could water down its commitments by inserting vague language into the final text. As negotiations over U.S.-China normalization in the late 1970s show, the Trump administration must be vigilant about policing the faithfulness of the Chinese text, lest it become a backdoor vehicle for undermining the deal.</p><p>In December 1978, in their rush to normalize bilateral ties with China, U.S. diplomats blundered by allowing Beijing to slip an important change into the Chinese text of the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations. This normalization communique was hailed as a “historic development,” marking the end of three decades of isolation and of official U.S. recognition for Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers to be a renegade province. Historian Enrico Fardella calls this normalization President Jimmy Carter’s “greatest success.” Indeed, the American opening to China was a key moment in the United States’ Cold War maneuvering against the Soviet Union.</p><p>However, on Jan. 3, 1979, Michel Oksenberg, a China specialist on the National Security Council, sent a remarkable memo to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s national security adviser, to warn about a “translation problem” in the normalization communique.</p><p>That problem boiled down to one word: “acknowledge.” In the 1972 Shanghai Communique, the foundational document of U.S.-China relations, the United States said that it “acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.”</p><p>This noncommittal language was crucial, because Washington wanted to pursue its own One-China policy, whereby the United States acknowledged but did not accept either Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan or any Taiwanese claim to statehood. Similarly, then, the normalization communique stated that the U.S. government “acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.”</p><p>But while the English word, “acknowledges,” is the same in both documents, in translation it turned into something different. The Shanghai Communique used the word-phrase “renshi dao” (认识到), which connotes knowledge and understanding, whereas the normalization communique used the verb “chengren” (承认), a stronger term that connotes recognition and assent.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>In his memo, Oksenberg informed Brzezinski that during the “hectic days” before the normalization communique was finalized, the National Security Council “never saw” the Chinese version of the text because it “worked entirely from the English.” Right before the normalization communique was released, the U.S. Liaison Office (USLO) in Beijing assured Oksenberg that there were “no problems” with the Chinese translation. Afterward, the USLO explained to Oksenberg that it had noticed the insertion of “chengren” but decided not to inform Washington, because Chinese officials used “several English-Chinese dictionaries” to argue that there was “no substantive significance” to the new translation.</p><p>Oksenberg disagreed. He worried that the administration had “tampered with the ‘holy writ’ of the Shanghai Communique” and that “more than a few linguists” would say that “chengren” “denotes a stronger acceptance of the Chinese position” than “renshi dao.” Oksenberg implied that, had he seen the draft Chinese text, Washington would have pushed back.</p><p>The ramifications of this change were potentially significant. U.S. supporters of the Taiwanese regime, which had built a formidable China lobby in Washington, could have seized on the more conciliatory Chinese phrasing to portray Carter administration officials as dupes and bolster resistance to normalization policies on Capitol Hill.</p><p>To avoid these minefields, Oksenberg recommended a three-pronged defense: First, both governments had “worked from the English text”; second, the U.S. view was “expressed in the English”; and third, “chengren” was used by other countries with China. Brzezinski underlined the words “expressed in the English” and wrote “Yes. ZB.” Then-Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher later confirmed during congressional debates that the United States would “regard the English text as being the binding text.”</p><p>Beijing, however, saw the Chinese text as equally binding. The Foreign Ministry’s official history of U.S.-China relations foregrounds the United States’ agreement to “chengren” — Beijing‘s view on Taiwan.</p><p>And the conflict wasn’t simply one of language. It seems that Beijing took advantage of the American preference for English-first negotiations to advance its own foreign policy goals. Shi Yanhua, a government translator who worked on the normalization communique, recalled years later that she was present when Zhang Wenjin, a senior diplomat who had helped draft the document, purposefully changed “renshi dao” to “chengren” because the latter term was “more in line” with Beijing’s policy on Taiwan. These facts contradicted the assurances provided to the USLO that the new translation had “no substantive significance.”</p><p>This disclosure indicates that the USLO’s failure to object to the new Chinese text was a blunder, one that could have either strained U.S.-Chinese relations or pinned the United States to a policy that it did not support.</p><p>Fortunately for Washington, the Chinese, preoccupied with domestic development and strategic competition with the Soviet Union and Vietnam, chose to do little as the United States turned its own understanding of the agreement into policy in the region. In April 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act created a legal basis for the de facto diplomatic relations that still exist between the United States and Taiwan. The Six Assurances offered to Taiwan in 1982 affirmed that the United States “would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.”</p><p>That does not mean, however, that China’s linguistic chicanery was meaningless. Domestically, it helped fortify the legitimacy of Beijing’s claim to Taiwan, supporting a version of China in which its Communist Party controls Taipei.</p><p>And the history of this mistake may not be over. As China seeks increasingly to “set the parameters of acceptable discourse” in global affairs, especially with regard to its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, the words of the normalization communique may still become potent weapons of statecraft, diplomatic ammunition in a potential (if contentious) case for sovereignty should Beijing ever decide to force the issue of reunification with Taiwan.</p><p>This blunder was not a one-off occurrence. Over the past 40 years, Western observers often overlooked what Beijing was saying about its national ambitions. The policy of engagement that Washington has pursued with China may have been its best option, but if successive administrations had taken Beijing’s words more seriously, the United States might have been more proactive in safeguarding the international order from the political, economic and security challenges posed by an authoritarian superpower — challenges that have necessitated a new trade agreement today.</p><p>With U.S.-China relations at their lowest ebb in two decades, and the two countries’ governments increasingly divided over issues of trade, technology, geopolitics and human rights, the normalization communique is a lesson in the overconfidence that led many Americans to overlook Chinese intentions.</p><p>The Trump administration must not let China pull another fast one as it translates this new agreement. Because, for Beijing, reality is not “expressed in the English.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qcQ5lNwUrJcNYe2avGWm-MarXPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLHCXBC6IMI6RNSWENWGEFHPAE.jpg'),(16,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/23/taiwans-bikini-hiker-dies-after-falling-into-ravine-solo-trek/','The Washington Post',NULL,'Taiwan\'s \'bikini hiker\' dies after falling into ravine on solo trek',NULL,NULL,'Amy B Wang','1548268145000',1548268145000,'<p>If there was any doubt that hiking was Gigi Wu’s passion, a visit to her social media accounts would have put that to rest.</p><p>Her Facebook page was a veritable tour of Taiwan’s tallest peaks and most scenic mountain ranges.

A cause of death was not immediately confirmed.</p><p>Photos obtained by TVBS News showed an array of hiking gear scattered across a forest floor, reportedly near where Wu had fallen.

',NULL,'Ketian Vivian Zhang','1554717670000',1554717670000,'<p>On March 31, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that two Chinese Air Force (PLAAF) J-11 jets crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait. This violated the long-held tacit agreement between China and Taiwan that neither side should cross the median line.</p><p>Taiwan deemed this “an intentional, reckless & provocative action,” which triggered “a 10-minute standoff” in the air. As Asia security expert Bonnie S. Glaser notes that, if intentional, this would be the first PLAAF crossing of the median line in about 20 years. In this case, it’s likely that Taiwan, not the South China Sea, prompted Beijing’s actions.</p><p>An unresolved issue from the Chinese civil war, Taiwan has always been a “core interest” to party leaders in Beijing. Here are some key takeaways from my research on China-Taiwan relations.</p><h3>What does the PLAAF move signal?</h3><p>Granted, there is much we don’t know about this specific PLAAF incident. But my work on cross-Strait relations suggests that it’s quite possible the PLAAF behavior is intentional — and serves as a coercive signal to Taiwan and the United States. Here’s what you need to know:</p><h3>1. The U.S. agreed to sell fighter jets to Taiwan. </h3><p>In March, the United States agreed to sell F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan — the fourth-generation model. The last U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan took place in September 1992.</p><p>[China-U.S.-Taiwan relations are in choppy waters. Here’s what’s going on.]</p><p>Beijing considers selling weapons platforms such as jet fighters and submarines to Taiwan an implicit red line. In the past, China used coercion to deter countries from selling these weapons platforms to Taiwan. This suggests that last week’s PLAAF incident is intended to send a deterrent signal about fighter sales to both Taiwan and the United States.</p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Defense lodged protests against the United States regarding the sale, reiterating that China will “take all necessary measures” to resolutely defend its sovereignty. The Trump administration decided on April 5 to put on hold the F-16V deal until the United States strikes a trade deal with China, suggesting that China may have used the bilateral trade talks as a bargaining chip.</p><h3>2. U.S. ships were in the Taiwan Strait. </h3><p>On March 24, U.S. naval and Coast Guard ships passed through the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese Foreign Ministry protested, urging the United States to exercise caution.</p><h3>3. Taiwan’s president stopped off in Hawaii. </h3><p>That same week, Tsai Ing-wen made a U.S. stopover. China protested that this was in violation of the “one China” policy, which calls for the United States and other countries to refrain from official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</p><p>These actions appear to be relatively minor provocations in China’s ledger. But to Beijing, not taking coercive actions to demonstrate its resolve might produce more provocative actions from Taiwan and the United States in the future.</p><h3>How does China use its tools of coercion?</h3><p>In the past, China has utilized both military and nonmilitary tools to force Taiwan and other countries to stop and deter actions that China deems threatening. My book project suggests that China uses these tools selectively. And Beijing tends to target the United States less, because of China’s economic vulnerability vis-a-vis the United States.</p><p>[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]</p><p>Here’s an example. When France sold Mirage 2000 fighter jets Taiwan in 1992, China responded with harsh diplomatic and economic sanctions, including a ban on French wheat exports to China, awarding a subway bid in China’s southern city of Guangzhou to Germany, freezing a French project to build a nuclear power plant in China and closing the French consulate in Guangzhou.</p><p>In this case, China had “exit options.” For instance, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were all bidding on the Guangzhou subway project. The Chinese ambassador to France stated in his memoir that China turned to Germany to sanction France.</p><h3>Fear of U.S. economic retaliation held China back in 1992.</h3><p>Concerns about U.S.-China economic relations kept Beijing from giving a similar response after the 1992 U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan. Just 12 days after the sale, Congress passed a bill linking Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status with Chinese human rights conditions.</p><p>Evidence from my working paper reveals that Chinese government analysts during the 1992 F-16 episode waited anxiously. Would President George H.W. Bush veto the conditional extension of MFN status — and would Congress then overturn the veto? Bush eventually vetoed the bill, 26 days after the sale.</p><p>Losing MFN status would be detrimental to China’s exports, a former World Bank official in charge of China confirmed to me. And China and the United States were slated to engage in market entry negotiations three weeks after the weapons sales. The U.S. trade representative threatened 100 percent tariffs on $4 billion worth of Chinese goods if the two sides did not reach an agreement.</p><p>[The U.S. and China are playing a dangerous game. What comes next?]</p><p>China expert John W. Garver writes that Deng Xiaoping endorsed an internal Chinese Foreign Ministry report at the time, because “China needed to give priority to economic interests” and avoid a trade war in which Beijing stood to lose the most.</p><p>By 1994, President Clinton had delinked MFN status from Chinese human rights conditions. China subsequently responded with coercion in 1995 when Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui gave a talk at Cornell University and Taiwan held elections in 1996. Beijing conducted missile tests and recalled the Chinese ambassador to the United States.</p><p>These measures, Beijing hoped, would deter the United States and other countries from granting Lee a visa in the future, which China perceived as supporting Taiwan’s path toward de jure independence.</p><p>In this light, President Tsai Ing-wen’s recent transit via Hawaii and meetings with senior U.S. leaders could be a contributing factor to China’s reactions. Barring an official invitation for the Taiwanese president to visit the United States, Chinese coercion regarding these transits probably will focus on Taiwan. China’s goal, most likely, is to deter Taiwanese leaders from transiting via the United States or meeting with senior U.S. officials in the future.</p><p>China and Taiwan have long had a tense relationship. But as Chinese economic clout increased, Beijing began to threaten economic and diplomatic sanctions against U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan. In the long run, if China successfully diversifies its export markets and becomes less dependent on U.S.-China trade, Beijing is likely to become more coercive — especially regarding Taiwan.</p><p>Ketian Vivian Zhang is a postdoctoral fellow at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.

They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</p><p>In addition to needing pollen and nectar like other bees, Shelomi said, sweat bees, which are dark-colored and metallic, will occasionally need salt to supplement their diet. A study this month from the Kansas Entomological Society found that sweat bees also look to tears as a protein source.</p><p>“They don’t seem to be bothered by people, so they will go to any source of salt,\" Shelomi said. \"I think they’re kind of dumb if they come to humans for their salt. They haven’t figured out what we are.”</p><p>While there are more than 1,000 species of sweat bees in the United States, Canada and Central America, according to Terminix, they are almost painless and sting only when they are provoked. On the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, a scale of relative agony caused by sawflies, wasps, bees and ants, the sweat bee comes in at the lowest level of pain. Described by the index as “light, ephemeral, almost fruity,” the puny sting is compared to “a tiny spark [that] has singed a single hair on your arm.”</p><p>“She couldn’t have asked for a better bee to sting her in her eye,” Shelomi said.</p><p>He was discharged and is expected to make a full recovery, KRON-TV reported. The bees are still alive, Hung told the BBC, and will now be studied.</p><p>“This is the first time in Taiwan we’ve seen something like this,” the doctor said.</p><p>Even though the case is probably the most unusual he’s heard about in his time studying entomology, Shelomi emphasized that what happened at the gravesite in Taiwan was a fascinating but not worrisome “freak occurrence.”</p><p>“The woman will be fine. The bees will be fine,” Shelomi stressed. “This is not something that people need to concern themselves with. I don’t expect we’ll ever see it again.”</p><p>More from Morning Mix:</p><p>A ‘selfless’ high school principal donated bone marrow to a stranger.

',NULL,'Zhiqun Zhu','1547678767000',1547678767000,'<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping made a high-profile speech regarding Taiwan on Jan. 2 to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1979 “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan.” That 1979 speech was the Chinese government’s first policy overture to Taiwan, which replaced “liberation of Taiwan” with “peaceful unification” as the goal. Xi’s speech marking the occasion has generated heated debates about Taiwan-China relations.</p><p>Based on Taiwan’s official reactions so far, one can expect a stormy relationship between the two sides in the next couple of years — a battle that is sure to become part of the current tensions between the United States and China.</p><p>Right after World War II, the Chinese civil war resumed between Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces and Mao Zedong’s communist guerrillas. Chiang was defeated and moved his Republic of China government to Taiwan, while Mao declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China on the mainland in 1949. The two sides remained bitter enemies and had no official contact during much of the Cold War. Relations gradually improved since the 1980s as Taiwan lifted martial law and the mainland started to open up.</p><p>Over the years, a distinct Taiwanese identity has grown while the Chinese identity has declined in Taiwan. Since Taiwan became a multiparty democracy, cross-strait relations have become more complicated. But when Ma Ying-jeou was in power in Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, Taiwan-China relations were stable and friendly, and cross-strait exchanges were dynamic.</p><p>That changed with the election of the Democratic Progressive Party’s Tsai Ing-wen as president of the Republic of China in 2016, and the relationship between Beijing and Taiwan has been characterized by stalemate over the past few years. From Beijing’s perspective, 2019 was a fitting time to send a new message — and a new warning — to Taiwan. A man with a sense of historical mission, Xi has been seriously eyeing Taiwan as part of his “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation. As he stated confidently in his speech, Taiwan must and will be united with the motherland.</p><p>In his speech, Xi reiterated Beijing’s long-standing policy toward Taiwan, with “national unification” as the objective and “One Country, Two Systems” as the model. In this sense, Xi’s speech is a continuation of previous official statements, which focused on Beijing’s intent for peaceful reunification and cross-strait exchanges while reserving the right to use force, if necessary.</p><p>But Xi’s speech also contained something new. First, he introduced more flexibility to the “One Country, Two Systems” model proposed for Taiwan. That’s important, because China operates under a “One Country, Two Systems” model elsewhere, in its relationship with Hong Kong and Macao. Xi is undoubtedly aware of the grim reality in Hong Kong, where frustration is growing over how Beijing has rapidly undermined the city’s political institutions, democratic activism and media freedom.</p><p>Not wanting to replicate that situation with Taiwan, Xi is making a significant policy adjustment. In contrast to the Hong Kong case, where the “One Country, Two Systems” model was imposed in 1997 without input from the Hong Kong people, what Xi is suggesting is involving the Taiwanese in developing a new model for Taiwan. The move injects a level of self-determination for Taiwan into the unification model.</p><p>Xi also proposed that representatives from different parties and walks of life in Taiwan should join Beijing in political consultations to discuss cross-strait relations and make political arrangements for Taiwan’s future. This might be the most intriguing and innovative part of his speech since it essentially kicks off the unification process by sidestepping the unpopular governing party. He did not set a timetable for unification, but this proposal, if implemented, would represent a giant stride toward Beijing’s goal of unification with specific steps being taken to prepare for the future.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the Tsai administration immediately and categorically rejected Xi’s proposal without much deliberation. Were the Tsai administration open to discussions, or willing to offer a plan to improve cross-strait relations, Taiwan could use its vibrant democracy as a tool to shape the future of the Chinese mainland. Beijing says anything can be discussed under “one China”; Taiwan certainly can and should raise its preconditions for unification. That would put tremendous pressure on the mainland to move toward democratization.</p><p>Tsai’s position toward the mainland hardened last year. Now she only uses “China” to refer to the mainland instead of the more conciliatory “Chinese mainland” that she used during her first year in office. In Taiwan, when politicians refer to the mainland as “China”, it’s a clear indication of their anti-China and pro-independence position. </p><p>Tsai’s shift toward a more hard-line approach has many possible causes: loss of five diplomatic allies of the ROC during her term so far; perceived “bullying” by Beijing in international arenas; her strategy to play the China card to deflect internal discontent toward her lackluster performance; and her party’s loss in local elections last year.</p><p>Though Xi has offered more flexibility in the unification process, it is clear that Beijing’s “wait and see” attitude toward Tsai is over. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office has for the first time publicly lashed out at Tsai as a “separatist.” It’s almost certain that Tsai will become more hard-line before the 2020 Taiwan elections as she struggles to be reelected. Her leadership has been disappointing to most Taiwanese, including her supporters. To be tough on China and brand herself as a leader to defend Taiwan’s sovereignty may help her win back some votes.</p><p>Xi’s firm determination and Tsai’s strong resistance suggest that the Taiwan Strait will not be calm in the next couple of years. That has real implications for the United States. Tsai will strive to strengthen relations with the United States while maintaining an anti-China stance. And there is reason to believe Washington will be amenable to her overtures. President Trump signed several pro-Taiwan bills into law in 2018, including the Taiwan Travel Act and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, moves that Beijing resents.</p><p>The U.S. government will likely continue to play the Taiwan card when dealing with China, but Taiwan’s people must be cautious and sober. It is not inconceivable that someday Trump may decide to sell out Taiwan in order to strike a deal with China. Taiwan’s future is inextricably linked to China’s. Instead of turning away from China, Taiwan may wish to work with Beijing and seek a mutually acceptable outcome for the island democracy.</p><p>This post has been updated.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IT_a6-bPDQqr044P1Mo0zlAYsi0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LKA3U7ANOII6TDYMN6DYUJRIRI.jpg'),(22,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/09/two-views-tom-dundon-carolina-hurricanes-savior-aaf-scourge/','The Washington Post',NULL,'The two views of Tom Dundon: Carolina Hurricanes\' savior and AAF scourge','A relatively unknown Texas businessman is making headlines with bold moves that have produced varying results',NULL,'Rick Maese','1554864967000',1554864967000,'<p>Tom Dundon was able to build his fortune without fame, found success far from the spotlight and seemed to have all the answers, even if there was no real public questioning.</p><p>“I never did any interviews and never wanted any attention,” Dundon said.</p><p>There’s no avoiding it now. Suddenly, there is a whole lot to talk about — and even more that he says he can’t talk about. In his first full season as professional sports team owner, Dundon’s Carolina Hurricanes are back in the NHL playoffs, snapping the league’s longest dry spell and drawing the spotlight to the on-ice party in one of the league’s smallest markets.</p><p>“Given where the franchise has been, just this step of getting to the playoffs and not having to talk any more, not think any more about what used to be,” Dundon said in an interview this week. “We can now be pretty focused on what we want the Hurricanes to be going forward.”</p><p>Depending on one’s viewpoint, the Hurricanes are either the feel-good story of the NHL season or an affront to hockey’s tradition of stoic celebration. And their 47-year-old owner in his first full season is either a disrupter who bought an organization in need of disruption or the leader of a “bunch of jerks.” And it’s just possible that all those things are sort of true.</p><p>“Listen, there was some shaking that needed to be done,” NBC analyst Mike Milbury said. “… Whatever the formula was that was used down there, it’s shaken out a pretty good team, a team that’s made the playoffs for the first time in forever.”</p><p>But Dundon’s soaring Q rating in the sports world is largely due to his association with the Alliance of American Football, a minor league operation that had garnered attention for its heady ambitions and quick demise. As his Hurricanes take the ice against the Washington Capitals in the opening round this week, Dundon is still picking up the pieces from his short-lived, high-priced foray into professional football.</p><p>[As Capitals prepare Stanley Cup defense, Todd Reirden\'s son faces an ongoing battle]</p><p>In January he swooped in as a savior, pledging $250 million to rescue a league that was struggling to pay its bills. But less than seven weeks later, Dundon decided to pull the plug eight games into the AAF’s inaugural season, cutting his losses — estimated at $70 million — and dooming a start-up just as it was getting started.</p><p>Although rumors had been swirling, the swift ax caught many by surprise. Team and league officials were given no advance warning, and the handling of the situation has been roundly criticized. Players, coaches and team employees stopped drawing a salary immediately. Many were left stranded in cities without housing and forced to pay for flights home. Those who were injured were suddenly on the hook for necessary medical expenses.</p><p>“My thing is, I don’t know who the dude is — Tom Dundon, whatever his name is — you could have at least finished out the season, these last two games,” said Taiwan Jones, a former Michigan State player who signed with the AAF team in Memphis barely 24 hours before the league folded. “…You took that away. You could have folded this at the end of the season.”</p><p>Dundon declined to answer questions this week about the football league, citing ongoing legal issues that need to be worked out. Last week, the league put out an unsigned statement, saying: “We understand the difficulty that this decision has caused for many people and for that we are very sorry. This is not the way we wanted it to end, but we are also committed to working on solutions for all outstanding issues to the best of our ability.”</p><p>[This linebacker broke his arm playing in the AAF. Three days later the league folded.]</p><p>A maverick making calculated risks</p><p>The recent hockey turnaround and the football flop are among the most high-profile business dealings of Dundon’s wildly successful career. He has a net worth that has been estimated around $1 billion, built largely from working in financial services and auto lending after a failed foray into the food industry. His financial firm is based in Dallas, where he attended Southern Methodist University. His splashy venture into the sports world has garnered attention and made headlines, but his approach shouldn’t surprise anyone who followed his career marked by bold ideas, calculated decisions and big results.</p><p>“I try to measure every risk,” he said, speaking generally about business philosophy and his hockey franchise. “I don’t think we do anything that’s not measured. … I’m not a risk-taker. I’m not going to jump out of an airplane with a parachute.”</p><p>In NHL circles, Dundon has quickly established himself as a maverick of sorts, an owner who didn’t need to sit in the background or rely on an old playbook. He purchased controlling interest of the franchise for $420 million, taking over in January 2018. The franchise was floundering, struggling in the standings and in the stands.</p><p>Thirteen years had passed since Carolina’s Stanley Cup championship and 10 since its previous postseason appearance. It was time for change, even if some were uneasy about what that might mean.</p><p>“The truth is, we have a small group of very passionate fans. The job was to grow that number,” Dundon said. “So there wasn’t a lot of risk when you\'re on the lower end. We only had upside.”</p><p>After just a couple of months of ownership, Dundon demoted general manager Ron Francis, perhaps the franchise’s greatest player and wildly popular with fans. He was later fired, though his jersey still hangs from the rafters at PNC Arena. The coach, Bill Peters, resigned after the season. Dundon eventually gave his interim GM Don Waddell the job permanently and promoted assistant coach Rod Brind’Amour, who was a captain on Carolina’s championship team, to head coach.</p><p>[Capitals\' title defense will begin against red-hot, scrappy Hurricanes]</p><p>He was disruptive, challenging his staff to rethink the way it did things and scrutinize costs. Nothing was sacred, and not everything was popular. Radio play-by-play announcer Chuck Kaiton had covered the franchise since its inaugural season in 1979, moving from Hartford, Conn., to Raleigh and never missing a game. He was reportedly offered an 80 percent pay cut last spring, which was essentially an invitation to leave.</p><p>“He sees things differently and doesn’t get emotional about his decisions” is how a friend, Charlotte Jones Anderson, a Dallas Cowboys executive vice president, once explained Dundon to the Dallas Morning News.</p><p>In Dundon’s other businesses, his track record lent credibility to his new ideas. “The difference here is you come in and you want to do something different — people start off thinking, ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about because you’re not a hockey person or you haven’t been in the sports business,’\" he said. \" … I wouldn’t want to overstate that as being difficult, just that it’s different.”</p><p>Presiding over ‘a bunch of jerks’</p><p>Dundon liked what he was seeing on the roster and behind the scenes. The team drafted Andrei Svechnikov with the second pick, signed free agent goaltender Petr Mrazek to a team-friendly one-year, $1.5 million deal and acquired winger Micheal Ferland and defenseman Dougie Hamilton in a trade with Calgary. The team later named Justin Williams its captain and would see 21-year-old Sebastian Aho continue to blossom into a dominant first-line center.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Perhaps the most visible change came following home wins this season, when the Hurricanes received considerable attention for their elaborately choreographed postgame celebrations. Players did a limbo line under a hockey stick and played duck-duck-goose on the ice. Williams used his helmet as a bowling ball, knocking down teammates lined up like pins, and a pair of players fished from the bench, reeling in a teammate flopping on the ice.</p><p>“All those little celebrations somehow managed to be a cohesive thing for them, despite getting some pretty strong criticism from up north,” Milbury said.</p><p>Old-school purists with ice in their veins weren’t amused. Canadian analyst Don Cherry called the Hurricanes “a bunch of jerks.” Rather than kowtow to traditionalists, the team responded by printing T-shirts that read “A bunch of jerks.” They sold several thousand, and the team had an identity.</p><p>“I think it’s been great,” Dundon told ESPN. “I’m glad [Cherry’s] talking about us. People don’t always talk about the Hurricanes, so I hope he keeps talking about us.”</p><p>While some bristled when the team opted to wear Hartford Whalers jerseys for a pair of games, many more started taking notice of what the Hurricanes were doing. Attendance increased more than 15 percent on the season, and according to a team official, new season ticket sales are up 260 percent from this time a year ago.</p><p>“He is a very smart guy, and he applied what worked for him in his other businesses to Carolina,” Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks’ owner, said in an email. “It’s obviously worked for him.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs feels different than other business success, he said, in part because it’s a shared accomplishment and the culmination of months and months of work. “I wasn’t looking to be vindicated,” he said. “I just wanted the organization to take this step because things tend to be easier when you’re talking about the future versus the past. We don’t have to talk about the past any more.”</p><p>But people continue to talk about his role in ending the AAF midseason, even as Dundon maintains his silence on the matter.</p><p>“He was in a bad spot but it also seems like he doesn’t care,” Jones said. \"He didn’t come out and make a [personal] statement or nothing because it doesn’t affect him — which it doesn’t. You have money.”</p><p>Dundon knows for now people are talking about him and his loud entrance into the sports world. That wasn’t his goal, but at least they’re talking, he figures, particularly about the future of the Hurricanes.</p><p>“When I bought the team, I realized the Carolina Hurricanes weren’t a topic of conversation in the world, and they have to be,” Dundon said. “Long-term, it needs to be about our players and our coaching. But short-term, I felt like I had to help. I think you’ll find over time that I’ll move into the shadows. The more the team is the story, the better.”</p><p>Tramel Raggs contributed to this report.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c1_vUGKQtmJyPIlibd9pkUL7CUw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W5ESUYBULII6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg'),(23,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-might-china-want-to-steal-these-silicon-secrets/2019/04/11/55ebbdf4-5c56-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Why Might China Want to Steal These Silicon Secrets?','ASML’s technology will be crucial for making the next generation of chips.

A U.S. court made XTAL pay $230 million in damages to ASML last year, but its links to the Chinese state weren’t clear at the time. </p><p>ASML doesn’t enjoy the name recognition of an Apple Inc., Intel Corp. or Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., but it is Europe’s second-biggest technology company by market capitalization. The world’s chipmakers buy its machines in order to manufacture the semiconductors that go into our smartphones, computers, cars and servers. ASML’s biggest customers are Intel and Samsung, as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which makes iPhone chips for Apple.</p><p>The Dutch company has one serious advantage over rivals Nikon Corp. and Canon Inc. – it’s the only firm to have mastered next-generation extreme ultraviolet lithography. Lithography is the process by which circuit patterns are etched onto silicon wafers. The EUV process will allow the printing of circuits that are more than 10 times smaller than the current standard.</p><p>The EUV machines cost more than 100 million euros ($113 million) apiece, and are starting to be delivered. The innovation could put off the day that Moore’s Law, which says that processing power doubles every 18 months, no longer holds true.</p><p>That’s why the firm’s technology would be particularly attractive to China. The country aims to spend some $150 billion over a decade to assume a leading role in technology design and manufacturing as part of its “Made in China 2025” push. Although it is a hub for electronics manufacturing, assembling iPhones, laptops, smart speakers and more, a lot of the crucial underlying technology is imported, including some $200 billion of annual semiconductor imports. China accounted for 17 percent of ASML’s 11 billion euros in sales last year.</p><p>This production push got a lift from the U.S. Commerce Department’s move last year to ban Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp. from buying American-made components. Though the embargo attempt fell through, the threat such a prohibition would have posed to domestic output is a lesson that has been learned. If China wants to have a standalone semiconductor industry, then it also needs to gain proficiency in the equipment needed to make the chips. One reason it can’t just buy this is that there’s a limit to how many EUV machines ASML can produce: it expects to ship just 30 such systems in 2019, up from 18 last year. The same goes for other lithography equipment.</p><p>Click here for a QuickTake on China’s technology push</p><p>It’s unclear what important technology, if any, was stolen by XTAL, whose parent Dongfang Jingyuan has “indirect links” to China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, according to the FD. The newspaper said the theft comprised Source codes, software, price strategies, and secret user manuals. A spokeswoman for ASML told Bloomberg News that “There is no blueprint on the street where you can build a lithography machine.”</p><p>But if there was any doubt about how serious China is about silicon independence, the allegations about the ASML theft, if true, will surely dispel it.</p><p>To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jennifer Ryan at jryan13@bloomberg.net</p><p>This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p><p>Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe’s technology, media and communications industries.

Descalso went to second on the throw to the plate and scored when the next batter, Caratini, doubled to right-center against Francisco Liriano.</p><p>By that point, a steady rain had begun. Shortly after the seventh inning ended, a bolt of lightning flashed in the distance beyond center field and the umpires stopped play.</p><p>EARLY EXIT</p><p>Maddon was ejected in the bottom of the fifth by plate umpire Mike Estabrook for arguing balls and strikes.</p><p>With runners on first and second and one out, Caratini took a low breaking ball on a 3-1 pitch for a strike. After hearing complaints from the Cubs dugout, Estabrook took a few steps down the third base line and held up a hand, essentially saying that was enough.</p><p>Maddon walked out and slowly made his way to the home plate area. He was ejected almost immediately after speaking to Estabrook.</p><p>TRAINER’S ROOM</p><p>Cubs: If the hamate bone in Caratini’s left hand is broken, the fear is surgery could be required and he’d be sidelined four to six weeks. Oddly, Caratini was injured on the first pitch of his at-bat in the seventh. “The first swing I felt a crack, but I felt hot so I kept going,” he said. “Once I got to second base and I took my glove off, I could tell there was something wrong.”</p><p>ROSTER MOVES</p><p>Pirates: INF Kevin Kramer was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis to take the roster spot of SS Kevin Newman, who was placed on the 10-day injured list with a lacerated finger on his right hand.</p><p>Cubs: RHP Jen-Ho Tseng was released.

Depending on how broadly “material support” is interpreted, the designation may complicate U.S. diplomatic and military cooperation with certain third-country officials, notably in Iraq and Lebanon, who deal with the Guard.</p><p>President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the step with great fanfare last week, opening a one-week consultation period with Congress during which members could have raised objections.</p><p>Lawmakers were broadly supportive, but congressional Iran hawks are now expressing concern that the administration may extend waivers on oil and nuclear sanctions. Those sanctions, which are unrelated to the Guard designation, were imposed last November following Trump’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that May.</p><p>They target major elements of Iran’s economy, notably its energy sector, by hitting foreign companies and governments with so-called “secondary sanctions” if they continue to do business with targeted Iranian entities. A main goal has been to dry up revenue from Iran’s oil exports, which the U.S. says is the main driver of the country’s funding of destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>In order not to shock oil markets with the sudden loss of Iranian crude, the administration granted several waivers that allowed some nations and Taiwan to continue their imports as long as they moved to reduce them to zero. Those waivers are due to expire in early May, and Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere are urging the administration not to renew any of them. They say extending even some of the eight waivers would run counter to Trump and Pompeo’s stated goal of keeping “maximum pressure” on Iran.</p><p>U.S. officials have been coy when asked about the waivers, leading to concern among hawks that some or all of them may be extended.</p><p>The administration’s point man for Iran, Brian Hook, has said that three of the waivers won’t need to be extended as those countries have eliminated all Iranian oil imports. But he has remained silent on the other five. Pompeo has similarly refused to comment on the possibility of extensions.</p><p>In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Pompeo was pressed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about whether the oil sanctions waivers, as well as waivers related to technical cooperation at Iranian nuclear facilities, would be extended. He suggested that some at the State Department were pushing for extensions.</p><p>“Let me urge you and urge the department unequivocally not to grant the nuclear waivers and not to grant the oil waivers,” Cruz said, “I think maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure.”</p><p>Pompeo demurred, but during a trip to South America over the weekend he bristled when asked if the Iran hawks had reason to be concerned.</p><p>“It’s ludicrous,” he told reporters accompanying him. “It’s ludicrous. Look, people want to tell stories, people want to sell newspapers. I’ve got it. Congressmen will grandstand, I’ve got that too. The State Department’s going to get it right. We understand our mission.”</p><p>Cruz was not impressed.</p><p>“The Senate Foreign Relations Committee needs to understand why some in the State Department think it’s a good idea to keep enriching the Ayatollah with oil billions and to let Iran keep spinning centrifuges in a bunker that they dug into the side of a mountain so they could build nuclear weapons,” he said in a statement released by his office.</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average 12 bottles.</p><p>The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibers will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibers, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture.</p><p>The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday’s Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. It comes in styles for men and women in green, white, navy and light blue. The shirts are not more expensive than other Polos.</p><p>Ralph Lauren has taken on environmental initiatives over the years, but it’s putting into place a more significant strategy aimed at changing both its corporate culture and how it thinks about the clothes it produces. The effort includes a new supply chain and sustainability officer, Halide Alagoz, who said more details will be released in June.</p><p>“At the moment we’re refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability,” she said.</p><p>Among the company’s other goals: the use of 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100% recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year.</p><p>Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment.</p><p>Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP24, in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action.</p><p>As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibers that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is “much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean.”</p><p>The broader question of biodegradability of such fibers remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said.</p><p>“There’s so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we’ll start looking at other opportunities,” he said. “Right now, we’re trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem? I think we’re creating solutions, or at least trying to find solutions.”</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
