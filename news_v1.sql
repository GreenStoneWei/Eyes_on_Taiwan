Rainfall rates over the ocean could be as high as 190mm per hour.</p><p>As Nepartak\'s eye makes landfall, it will lift the Pacific\'s surface by between one and two metres in what is known as a \"storm surge\". This is often the most devastating element of a typhoon, being similar to a small tsunami.</p><p>In the case of Super Typhoon Nepartak, the wind could also be destructive. Steady winds of 230 kilometres an hour will be boosted by gusts as high as 280km/h.</p><p>Curiously, this is the second typhoon called Nepartak, the first being a mere category 1 storm that hit the Philippines in November 2003.</p><p>Appropriately, the epithet Nepartak is derived from the name of a conquering warrior from the island of Kosrae in Micronesia.</p><p>Nepartak is likely to lose a lot of energy over Taiwan, but it is forecast to regain some strength over the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>The Chinese mainland is then under threat, mostly from torrential rainfall, as Nepartak makes landfall on the vulnerable coast of Fujian Province.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.aljazeera.com//mritems/Images/2016/7/7/c61fe7dcc6b747b0a904adde8906bc6e_18.jpg'),(11,'https://www.aljazeera.com//news/2017/05/taiwan-top-court-rules-favour-gay-marriage-170524063603646.html','Aljazeera',NULL,'Taiwan top court rules in favour of gay marriage','Judges on the island say current laws violate constitutional rights, but conservatives angered by ruling.',NULL,NULL,'2017-05-24T21:09:33Z',1495660173000,'<p>A top Taiwan court ruled in favour of gay marriage on Wednesday, a landmark ruling that paves the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex unions.</p><p>Twelve of 14 judges in the court, known as the Judicial Yuan, said current marriage laws violate the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.</p><p>It gave Taiwan\'s government two years to implement the ruling.</p><p>Video posted to social media showed crowds cheering and waving rainbow flags outside parliament in Taipei after the announcement was made.</p><p>Activists were already optimistic the decision would go in their favour.</p><p>But conservative groups had staged mass rallies against a change in the law.</p><p>At the heart of the case was a clause in Taiwan\'s Civil Code that an agreement to marry should be made between a man and a woman.</p><p>This \"violated\" the constitution\'s guarantees of freedom of marriage and people\'s equality, the court said.</p><p> WATCH: Demanding gay rights in Taiwan (2:29)</p><p>Chi Chia-wei, a 59-year-old gay rights campaigner who brought the case to the constitutional court, had urged judges to allow same-sex couples to register to marry the next day if they approved the change.</p><p>The Taipei city government, which also launched a case, had been rejecting marriage applications by same-sex couples and was seeking clarification of the law.</p><p>Al Jazeera\'s Adrian Brown, reporting from Taipei, said: \"Taiwan has in a sense become a beacon of gay rights.\"</p><p>He added that conservatives were likely to protest against the proposed change of law over the next two years and to call for a referendum.</p><p>\"They are angry and disappointed,\" Brown said. \"They say it\'s time for all Taiwanese people to have their say in this debate, and claim a cultural convention is under attack.\"</p><h2>\'Historic\' day in Asia</h2><p>Lawyer Huang Di-ying said the court\'s decision was \"historic\". </p><p>\"It will be a barometer of human rights protection in the region as Asia follows the United States\' and Europe\'s steps to recognise same-sex marriages,\" he said.

The duration of the incursion - some ten minutes - suggests it was no mere navigational mistake. </p><p>Taiwan scrambled aircraft to intercept the intruders. Taiwan\'s President Tsai Ing-wen has called for Chinese warplanes that cross the maritime line to be \"forcefully expelled\". </p><p>Taiwan - of course - is seen by Beijing as an inseparable part of China; its separation from the motherland merely a temporary phenomenon. </p><p>China\'s President Xi Jinping warned at the start of this year that unification remained China\'s ultimate goal irrespective of the differences between their two political systems. He made it clear that China would not \"abandon the use of force\" and that it retained the option \"of taking all necessary measures.\"</p><p>China remains preoccupied with Taiwan. Indeed many US strategic analysts see the re-establishment of Beijing\'s control over Taiwan as the primary goal driving its military modernisation programmes. </p><p>And an important aspect here is what is interpreted in the West as Beijing\'s anti-access and area denial strategy. In simple terms, this is the development of longer-range and more accurate weapons systems to push US forces (who might be coming to Taiwan\'s aid) further out into the Pacific. </p><p>Last month - in an effort to signal that it will continue to assert its rights of free passage - the US sent a destroyer and a Coast Guard cutter through the Taiwan Strait between China and Taiwan. This inevitably upset Beijing and was equally seen by the Taiwanese as a show of support.</p><p>Washington\'s efforts to demonstrate what it terms its \"freedom of navigation\" is highly controversial in Beijing, given its expansive claims to waters in the region. </p><p>It comes at a time of rising Sino-US tensions with differences over trade, technology, and China\'s growing military assertiveness. Add in unease in Beijing over the slowdown in its economy, which many China watchers fear could lead to President Xi pursuing a more nationalist stance, and it is easy to see why fears are growing about the course of the US-China relationship. </p><p>This weekend\'s incursion by Chinese warplanes is a reminder of the dangerous Taiwan dimension as well. </p><p>It was not always thus. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s the US established what became known as its \"One-China\" policy.</p><p>It recognised the Communist-run government in Beijing as the country\'s sole legitimate government. It acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China. Taiwan is thus part of China. It downgraded ties with Taiwan. </p><p>But equally it made it clear to Beijing that the US would \"consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means\" as being of \"grave concern to the US\". The US would support Taiwan\'s self-defence and left open the possibility of coming to Taiwan\'s aid if it were attacked. </p><p>But is this policy really credible in the face of China\'s growing military capabilities? And will Taiwan continue to be happy with the mere trappings of independence rather than the real thing? Is the Trump administration sending the wrong signals to Taiwan? </p><p>Mr Trump, for example, became the first president-elect since 1979 to speak directly to Taiwan\'s president. Some in his administration want to revisit the whole \"One-China\" policy. </p><p>Beijing has seen this US president abandon arms control agreements and alter the diplomatic status quo in the Middle East over Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

The man fled Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong last year.</p><p>Taiwanese officials have sought help from Hong Kong authorities to extradite the man, but Hong Kong officials say they cannot comply because of a lack of extradition agreement with Taiwan.</p><p>\"Are we happy to see a suspect that has committed a serious offence staying in Hong Kong and we\'re unable to deliver justice over the case?\" Mrs Lam said on 1 April while responding to media questions. </p><p>She added that mainland China and Macau were included in the proposed change to address a \"loophole\" in current laws. </p><p>A former British colony, Hong Kong is semi-autonomous under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. </p><p>The city has its own laws and its residents enjoy civil liberties unavailable to their mainland counterparts.  </p><p>Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US, but no such agreements have been reached with mainland China despite ongoing negotiations in the past two decades. </p><p>Critics have attributed such failures to poor legal protection for defendants under Chinese law. </p><p>Reporting by Jeff Li, BBC Chinese.</p>',NULL,NULL),(3,'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16164639','BBC',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16178545','BBC',NULL,NULL,'Taiwan profile - Timeline',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,1549017642000,'<p>A chronology of key events:</p><p>1683 - China\'s Qing Dynasty formally annexes Taiwan, which had hitherto been divided between aboriginal kingdoms and Chinese and European settlers, most prominently the Dutch.</p><p>1895 - China cedes Taiwan among other territories to Japan after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. </p><p>1915 - Tapani Incident prompts Japan to reform its administration of the settled population, which turns to civic and political activity.

Most were Hoklo Chinese from Fujian (Fukien) province or were Hakka Chinese, largely from Guangdong. The descendants of these two migrations now make up by far the largest population group.</p><p>In 1895, following Japan\'s victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government had no choice but to cede Taiwan to Japan.</p><p>But after World War Two, the Republic of China - one of the victors - began ruling Taiwan with the consent of its allies the US and UK, after Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China.</p><p>However in the next few years, the leader at the time Chiang Kai-shek\'s troops were beaten back by the Communist armies under Mao Zedong.</p><p>Chiang and the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government fled to Taiwan in 1949. This group, referred to as Mainland Chinese and then making up 1.5m people, dominated Taiwan\'s politics for many years, even though they only account for 14% of the population.</p><p>Having inherited an effective dictatorship, facing resistance from local people resentful of the 228 Massacre and authoritarian rule, and under pressure from a growing democracy movement, Chiang\'s son, Chiang Ching-kuo, began allowing a process of democratisation, which eventually led to the 2000 election of the island\'s first non-KMT president, Chen Shui-bian.</p><p>After decades of hostile intentions and angry rhetoric, relations between China and Taiwan started improving in the 1980s. China put forward a formula, known as \"one country, two systems\", under which Taiwan would be given significant autonomy if it accepted Chinese reunification. </p><p>The offer was rejected, but Taiwan did relax rules on visits to and investment in China. It also, in 1991, proclaimed the war with the People\'s Republic of China over.</p><p>There were also limited talks between the two sides\' unofficial representatives, though China\'s insistence that the Republic of China (ROC) government is illegitimate prevented government-to-government contact.</p><p>Beijing became alarmed in 2000, when Taiwan elected as president Chen Shui-bian, who had openly backed independence. </p><p>Mr Chen was re-elected in 2004, prompting China to pass a so-called anti-secession law in 2005, stating China\'s right to use \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it tried to secede from China.</p><p>In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president. He sought to improve relations with China, mainly through economic agreements.</p><p>In elections in January 2016, Tsai Ing-wen defeated Kuomintang party candidate Eric Chu. Mr Ma was barred by Taiwan\'s constitution from the seeking a third term in office. Ms Tsai leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leans towards independence from China.</p><p>After Donald Trump won the 2016 US election, she spoke to the president-elect in a phone call, in what was a break with US policy set in 1979 when formal relations were cut.</p><p>Throughout 2018, China stepped up pressure on international companies forcing them to list Taiwan as a part of China on their websites and threatening to block them for doing business in China if they failed to comply. </p><p>In November, Ms Tsai\'s political party received a heavy setback in regional elections perceived by Beijing as a blow to her separatist stance.</p><p>There is disagreement and confusion about what Taiwan is, and even what it should be called. </p><p>Chiang Kai-shek\'s Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China\'s seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government.</p><p>But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen to about 20.</p><p>China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan\'s leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. </p><p>It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces.</p><p>Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has most of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear.</p><p>While political progress has been slow, links between the two peoples and economies have grown sharply. Taiwanese companies have invested about $60bn (£40bn) in China, and up to one million Taiwanese now live there, many running Taiwanese factories.</p><p>Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China\'s own economy.</p><p>A controversial trade agreement sparked the \"Sunflower Movement\" in 2014 where students and activists occupied Taiwan\'s parliament protesting against what they call China\'s growing influence over Taiwan.</p><p>Officially, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) still favours eventual independence for Taiwan, while the KMT favours eventual re-unification. Opinion polls show only a small minority of Taiwanese support pursuing one or the other at the moment, with most preferring to stick with the current middle ground.</p><p>Yet more and more people say they feel Taiwanese rather than Chinese. Support for the DPP increased at the January 2016 election. This was partly because of dissatisfaction with the KMT\'s handling of economic matters, from the wealth gap to high housing prices, and partly because of worries that Mr Ma\'s administration was making Taiwan too dependent on Beijing. </p><p>The US is by far Taiwan\'s most important friend, and its only ally. </p><p>The relationship, forged during World War Two and the Cold War, underwent its sternest test in 1979, when President Jimmy Carter ended US diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in order to concentrate on burgeoning ties with China. </p><p>The US Congress, responding to the move, passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which promises to supply Taiwan with defensive weapons, and stressed that any attack by China would be considered of \"grave concern\" to the US.</p><p>Since then, US policy has been described as one of \"strategic ambiguity\", seeking to balance China\'s emergence as a regional power with US admiration for Taiwan\'s economic success and democratisation.</p><p>The pivotal role of the US was most clearly shown in 1996, when China conducted provocative missile tests to try and influence Taiwan\'s first direct presidential election. In response, US President Bill Clinton ordered the biggest display of US military power in Asia since the Vietnam War, sending ships to the Taiwan Strait, and a clear message to Beijing.</p>',NULL,NULL),(8,'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-46840201','BBC',NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'By News from Elsewhere...',NULL,1547209625000,'<p>A man has been fined in Taiwan for sending a cat that he no longer wanted via an express postal service, it\'s reported. </p><p>According to the UDN news website, a 33-year-old man surnamed Yang was fined NT$60,000 ($1,952; £1,522) this week, for violating the Taiwan Animal Protection Act, after he posted a Scottish fold cat in a sealed cardboard box to a local animal shelter in Banciao District. </p><p>He was also fined an additional NT$30,000 for violating the Statute for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Diseases, because staff at the centre found that the cat had not been vaccinated for rabies. </p><p>The New Taipei City Animal Protection and Health Inspection Office were able to identify the sender through the delivery service and police surveillance footage, and carried out an investigation into the incident. </p><p>They then contacted Mr Yang, who said he had tried to give the cat away because he no longer had time to look after it.

I can assure you that I, and my department, will continue to closely monitor developments in Hong Kong,\" Hunt said, according to a copy of the letter Patten shared with UK-based pressure group Hong Kong Watch. </p><p>\"It is clear that the relatively short formal consultation process has not been sufficient to capture the wide-ranging views on this important topic.</p><p>While Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, the city operates its own legal and political system, and citizens enjoy a number of freedoms not protected on the mainland. At present, Hong Kong does not have an extradition law with China, Taiwan or Macau, a situation officials in the city say has created loopholes preventing criminals from being brought to justice. </p><p>Fear that the law will allow dissidents and pro-democracy activists to be bundled over the border to China has dogged the bill since it was first suggested, however. </p><p>Business groups too have expressed concerns, prompting the government to remove nine economic crimes from the list of potentially extraditable offenses. The government also changed the minimum severity of offense from those carrying one year in prison to three. </p><p>In a statement responding to those changes, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said members continued \"to have serious concerns about the revised proposal.\"</p><p>\"Those concerns flow primarily from the fact that the new arrangements could be used for rendition from Hong Kong to a number of jurisdictions with criminal procedure systems very different from that of Hong Kong -- which provides strong protections for the legitimate rights of defendants -- without the opportunity for public and legislative scrutiny of the fairness of those systems and the specific safeguards that should be sought in cases originating from them,\" the AmCham statement said. </p><p>\"We strongly believe that the proposed arrangements will reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations.\"</p><p>Responding to reporter\'s questions about the law last month, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the extradition law was part of the city\'s \"international commitment to fight organized crime.\"</p><p>He said the foreign business community should support the effort, which \"will benefit (the) business environment.\" </p><p>\"If the accusation is that somebody may unwittingly become a political offender, then I have said repeatedly that the law at present, under our Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has clearly stated that this will not be possible,\" Lee added. </p><p>\"There is a provision to say that no matter how you purport that offense to be, if it relates to political opinion, religion, nationality or ethnicity, then it will not be surrenderable.\"</p><p>AmCham\'s statement is part of a growing chorus of condemnation of the law from multiple quarters. Critics of the law point to past situations where people have been snatched in Hong Kong and transported to China to face trial, including multiple booksellers and Chinese businessman Xiao Jianhua. </p><p>Last week, the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said the new law could enable the Chinese government to extradite reporters critical of Beijing, saying it would \"not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong.\"</p><p>\"Over the years, numerous journalists have been charged or harassed by mainland authorities with criminal allegations covered by the (law),\" it said.</p><p>\"The (law) will make it possible for mainland authorities to get hold of journalists in Hong Kong (on) all kinds of unfounded charges. This sword hanging over journalists will muzzle both the journalists and the whistleblowers, bringing an end to the limited freedom of speech that Hong Kong still enjoys.\"</p><p>The Hong Kong Bar Association has also criticized the new law, and questioned the government\'s assertion that there were loopholes in the city\'s current arrangements. </p><p></p>',NULL,NULL),(2,'https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/world/commercial-passenger-airplane-crashes-fast-facts/index.html','CNN','https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140731100605-es-sot-plane-crashes-in-parking-lot-00005623-story-body.jpg',NULL,'Commercial Passenger Airplane Crashes Fast Facts',NULL,NULL,'CNN Library','2019-04-05T01:22:38Z',1554427358000,'<p>These are commercial passenger airplane crashes with fatalities over 200 or ones that are otherwise notable.

Mar-a-Lago security subsequently admitted her.</p><p>But staff quickly became suspicious when she didn\'t know where she wanted to go inside the property. She told a receptionist she was there to attend a non-existent \"United Nations Chinese American Association\" event that evening. </p><p>After agents were alerted to Zhang\'s presence, she told them she was there to attend a \"United Nations Friendship Event\"between the United States and China, and produced what she claimed was an invitation to the event, the complaint says. But \"agents were unable to read it as it was in Chinese.\" No such event was scheduled to take place on the property at that time.</p><p>Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago on that date, though he was not on the property at the time of Zhang\'s alleged visit.</p><p>After she was detained, agents found she had multiple electronic devices including four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external \"hard drive type\" device and a thumb drive.</p><p>A preliminary investigation found malicious malware on the thumb drive, prosecutors say.</p><p>Late Tuesday, US Attorney\'s office spokeswoman Sarah Schall said the two passports Zhang was carrying were from the People\'s Republic of China.

Under Prime Minister Helen Clark, New Zealand in 2008 became the first developed country to sign a free-trade agreement with China. </p><p>Today, China is New Zealand\'s largest trading partner. Two-way trade between the countries was valued at more than $19 billion (28 billion New Zealand dollars) in 2018, according to New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade. China is also New Zealand\'s second-largest tourism market and largest source of international students.</p><p>However Wellington\'s ties to Beijing have raised alarm bells with the United States, New Zealand\'s longtime ally.</p><p>Along with Washington, New Zealand is a member of the exclusive intelligence sharing community known as \"Five Eyes,\" which also consists of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.</p><p>In an extraordinary statement to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2018, former US government analyst Peter Mattis said New Zealand\'s membership should be reviewed given its relationship with Beijing.</p><p>\"Australia and New Zealand both face substantial problems with interference by the Chinese Communist Party. In both cases, the CCP has gotten very close to or inside the political core, if you will, of both countries,\" Mattis told the commission.</p><p>Juggling the relationship with the US and China has become increasingly difficult for New Zealand, with relations between the two giants souring amid US President Donald Trump\'s escalating trade war.</p><p>Tensions with Beijing reached a new level in 2018 when New Zealand\'s Government Communications Security Bureau blocked Chinese technology company Huawei from providing 5G technology to one of the country\'s major telecommunication companies, Spark.</p><p>The US has been putting pressure on its allies and diplomatic partners to ditch Huawei over security concerns, a move which has been regularly condemned by Beijing.</p><p>Speaking to CNN in February, Andrew Campbell, a spokesman for Ardern, said the relationship had suffered some \"irritation ... because of the GCSB\'s decision regarding Huawei.\" </p><p>When asked whether Huawei would be on the agenda this weekend, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang evaded the question. </p><p>Ardern on the back foot</p><p>In recent months, Ardern has found herself under greater pressure from opposition politicians and critics to defend the strength of New Zealand\'s relationship with China.</p><p>In February, Ardern was forced to deny that China was deliberately dragging out the visa process for New Zealander diplomats and postponing trips by officials to Beijing.  </p><p>The same month, local media reported an Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai was mysteriously forced to turn back to Auckland on discovering that its paperwork referred to the disputed island of Taiwan. </p><p>At the time, Ardern denied it was a \"relationship\" issue with China, saying instead it was an administrative error.</p><p>But the postponement of a major Chinese-New Zealand tourism event that same month -- which Ardern put down to a scheduling issue -- also added to speculation of a rift.</p><p>Ardern\'s trip also comes at a sensitive time for New Zealand, just two weeks after the terrorist attack against two mosques in Christchurch in which 50 people died. She even said she would be cutting her trip to China short, as it didn\'t seem \"appropriate\" to be overseas at such a time.</p><p>Following global praise for her handling of the tragedy, the New Zealand leader has come under pressure from human rights group to raise the issue of China\'s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims with Xi. Up to two million Uyghurs have reportedly been detained in detention centers in the western region of Xinjiang, according to US government reports.</p><p>\"Given I\'ve raised it before, that should give you an indication,\" she said when asked by reporters this week.</p><p>Prior to her trip, a spokesman for the Prime Minister denied again that she was concerned about the relationship with China worsening under her leadership. \"China is one of our most important and far-reaching relationships. Our relationship is mature and resilient,\" the spokesman said.  </p><p>China researcher Young agreed with the official line.</p><p>\"I think if the relationship really was deteriorating in that way, then it would be far clearer.

They are also heating up faster than was believed, driven by climate change caused by humans.</p><p>The study, published this week in the journal Science, showed that the world\'s oceans have got much warmer since the 1960s. Its authors said 2018 would be the warmest year on record for oceans. </p><p>Read more on the study </p><p>But what happens when the oceans get warmer, and what does it mean for us?</p><p>Rising sea levels</p><p>When water heats up, it takes up more space. That means as oceans warm, sea levels rise. The study says this effect alone could make sea levels rise 30cm (12 inches) by the end of the century.</p><p>\"That doesn\'t sound like much, but there are many large cities around the world, much built on reclaimed land, that are not more than 30cm above sea level,\" says Stephen Simpson, associate professor in marine biology and global change at the University of Exeter, in the UK. \"Millions and millions of people would be displaced.\"</p><p>But on top of that, warming oceans are causing polar ice sheets to melt faster, which will make sea levels rise even more. </p><p>Read: 15 facts about sea level rise</p><p>The combination of melting ice and expanding water could cause sea levels to rise by up to a meter by 2100. Hundreds of millions of people could be forced to leave their homes.</p><p>Rising sea levels are already causing more flooding in the US, and within the next 30 years, more than 300,000 US homes could be flooded every other week, according to research from the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>Extreme weather gets more extreme</p><p>Warmer oceans make tropical storms more intense and longer lasting.</p><p>Hurricane Harvey, which brought more than 1.5 meters (60 inches) of rain over four days in late August 2017, was made worse by unusually warm ocean temperatures.</p><p>For coastal areas already struggling with rising seas, those storms will bring even more flooding.</p><p>Read: Yes, climate change made Harvey and Irma worse</p><p>Warming temperatures also mean changing rainfall patterns. \"We\'ll probably be seeing redistributing of water vapor in the atmosphere,\" says Brad Linsley, research professor Columbia University\'s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"Higher temperatures lead to more evaporation, so parts of the earth will get wetter and parts will get drier.\"</p><p>Ocean life under threat</p><p>Coral reefs are especially sensitive to warmer seas. Between 2016 and 2017, half the corals at the Great Barrier Reef were killed by two ocean heat waves. </p><p>Almost three-quarters of the world\'s coral reefs were affected by those heat waves and experts say warmer oceans mean these sorts of die-offs will become much more common.</p><p>Another problem for sea life is that increased flooding causes more nutrients to be washed into the sea. This leads to plankton blooms and ultimately causes some parts of the sea to be starved of oxygen, making it hard for fish to live there.</p><p>Warm oceans hold less oxygen, which makes the problem worse. Simpson says some areas of Japan, Taiwan and the Baltic Sea are seeing dramatic die-offs of fish because of low oxygen.</p><p>Food security</p><p>Fish species respond to warmer oceans by migrating to cooler areas, says Simpson. But the waters in some parts of the world are getting too warm for any fish -- and that could lead to food shortages in those areas.</p><p>\"There is a severe food security risk in the tropics,\" says Simpson. \"No species are already activated to temperatures warmer than the tropics, so you could see a real crash in food fish populations. And these are places where coastal nations often have no other protein in the diet other than the fish from coral reefs.\"</p><p>Melting sea ice</p><p>Warmer seas are causing sea ice to melt. Sea ice floats on the ocean surface, so when it melts it doesn\'t affect sea levels. But it means there\'s less sea ice to reflect heat from the sun back into space, which means the planet gets warmer.</p><p>It\'s bad news for animals that depend on sea ice to survive -- including polar bears. But it\'s also a problem for some Arctic communities.</p><p>Read: Polar bears will struggle to survive if climate change continues</p><p>\"The Inuit living in Canada, for example, is a culture based on sea ice,\" says Arnaud Czaja, a reader in physical oceanography at Imperial College London. \"They get their food by hunting seals and polar bears from sea ice, or fishing from sea ice. When the sea ice is disappearing that\'s not possible, so the whole culture is being lost.\"</p><p>Is there any good news?</p><p>While scientists say the new paper shows an alarming rate of increase in ocean temperatures, Simpson sees one chink of light.</p><p>\"The only positive is we now have a better understanding of the relationship between human emissions and ocean warming,\" he says. \"That gives stronger evidence as to why controlling emissions is so important for our generation -- and the next.\"</p><p></p>',NULL,NULL),(20,'https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/26/us/jon-huntsman-fast-facts/index.html','CNN','https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170919150511-jon-huntsman-09-19-2017-story-body.jpg',NULL,'Jon Huntsman Fast Facts',NULL,NULL,'CNN Library','2019-03-08T19:44:41Z',1552074281000,'<p> (CNN)Here\'s a look at the life of Jon Huntsman, US ambassador to Russia, former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican Presidential Candidate.</p><p>Personal:Birth date: March 26, 1960</p><p>Birth place: Palo Alto, California</p><p>Birth name: Jon Meade Huntsman Jr.</p><p>Father: Jon Meade Huntsman Sr., billionaire chemical magnate</p><p>Mother: Karen (Haight) Huntsman</p><p>Marriage: Mary Kaye Cooper (1983-present)</p><p>Children: Asha Bharati, adopted from India; Gracie Mei, adopted from China; William, Jon III, Elizabeth, Abigail and Mary Anne</p><p>Education: Attended University of Utah, 1978-1980; University of Pennsylvania, B.A. in Political Science, 1987</p><p>Religion: Mormon</p><p>Other Facts:Dropped out of high school in his senior year to play piano with local bands.

She is well-liked abroad for her reluctance to pick fights with China. But she is not popular at home. Recent polls put her approval rating below 30%. Her bid for re-election next year, already iffy, just got iffier. Lai Ching-te, her former prime minister, has declared that he will challenge Ms Tsai for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). It is the first time an incumbent president in Taiwan has been subjected to a primary. And the contest may anger China, since Mr Lai is a more vocal supporter than Ms Tsai of the idea that Taiwan should formally declare itself to be a distinct country from China—a move China says would be grounds for war.  </p><p>“Taiwan doesn’t want to be a second Hong Kong or Tibet,” declared Mr Lai as he registered for the primary this week, insinuating that Ms Tsai is not doing enough to ensure Taiwan’s independence. The DPP was thrashed in municipal elections in November by the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, which advocates warmer relations with China. Voters seemed disappointed that Ms Tsai’s efforts to stimulate the economy have had scant success. Growth is slowing. Wages have been stagnant for decades.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Following the defeat in November, Ms Tsai stepped down as leader of the DPP. A month later Mr Lai, a former mayor of the southern city of Tainan, resigned as prime minister, spurning Ms Tsai’s entreaties for him to stay. The primary will involve the two candidates giving televised presentations of their platforms, after which the party conducts an opinion poll of a sample of the whole electorate. The more popular candidate wins the nomination. The results will be announced on April 17th.</p><p>DPP activists had been panicking, as Ms Tsai has been trailing badly in the polls. They feared not only a further electoral setback, but one that would have put the government into the hands of a China-friendly leader just as China is pressing Taiwan to begin talks on unification. Some advocates of independence, fed up with Ms Tsai’s caution, are jubilant at Mr Lai’s announcement, both because they think Mr Lai has a better chance of winning and because they think he might be more assertive.</p><p>Ms Tsai’s supporters, meanwhile, are arguing that the primary could split the party and are making agonised calls for unity, by which they seem to mean Mr Lai’s withdrawal. Chen Chi-mai, the deputy prime minister and a supporter of Ms Tsai, argued in a Facebook post that China’s growing assertiveness makes divisions within the party especially dangerous. “The 2020 election will determine whether Taiwan survives or is extinguished,” he said. </p><p>Luckily for the DPP, the KMT also has no anointed candidate and its primary is still some months away. A former mayor of New Taipei City, Eric Chu, and a former speaker of parliament, Wang Jin-pyng, have both said they will run. The election will probably also feature an independent candidate, Ko Wen-je, the popular mayor of Taipei.  </p><p> Inevitably, China will be front and centre in the campaign. The authorities across the Taiwan Strait probably revile Mr Lai even more than they do Ms Tsai. That might encourage them to ease the pressure on Taiwan a bit over the next few months. The Chinese government knows from experience that attempts to intimidate Taiwanese voters tend to backfire, prompting them to back the candidate most hostile to its cherished goal of reunification.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(2,'https://www.economist.com/china/2019/02/09/does-china-understand-taiwan','The Economist',NULL,'Does China understand Taiwan?','Ostracism of pro-independence Taiwanese is dangerous and counterproductive',NULL,'','2019-02-09T00:00:00Z',1549670400000,'<p></p><p>IF CHINA’S RULERS ever decide to invade Taiwan—a grim but not impossible prospect—they will need good answers to two questions. First, would the People’s Liberation Army win? The consensus in Taipei is that the PLA is close to that goal but is not “100% sure” of victory. Second, would ordinary Taiwanese submit?</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Chinese leaders have limited patience for Taiwanese opinion. Their offer to the democratic island of 23m is ostensibly generous. Under the slogan “One Country, Two Systems”, Taiwan is promised lots of autonomy alongside access to China’s vast market. This is backed by honeyed words about unifying a family sundered for 70 years, since China’s civil war ended with the losing Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT) retreating to what they hoped would be temporary exile on Taiwan. Still, China is committed to using force to block any bid for formal independence.</p><p>Chinese optimists call time their ally, as Taiwan’s population ages and its economy slows. Chaguan visited Taiwan recently. It is true that China’s gleaming coastal cities make Taipei’s 1980s skyscrapers look shabby. But time is China’s foe too, says Freddy Lim, a heavy-metal rock star and legislator for Taiwan’s pro-independence New Power Party. Mr Lim cites polls showing that youngsters increasingly identify as Taiwanese and consider China another country, albeit one where they like to do business.</p><p>Put bluntly, China’s proposals sound creepy to many young, urban Taiwanese. In effect, they hear a demand to submit to marriage with a stern cousin, arranged decades ago: “I am rich now, let me cherish you—or I will kill you.”</p><p>Taiwanese defiance may anger China’s leaders. But they cannot safely ignore it. Any Chinese victory would need to be quick, with Taiwan’s will to fight broken so swiftly that calls for an American rescue become moot. Taiwanese security experts are frank about what they fear: a psychological collapse among the public, for instance after initial waves of Chinese missiles wreck more than half the island’s defences, or blow up oil and gas terminals to cut power supplies. Then there is the question of what happens the day after China wins. Politicians predict mass protests in Taiwanese cities. Would China send tanks to subdue its sullen new satrapy?</p><p>Alas, China has closed off avenues to answering such questions. Communist bosses growl that they will only engage with Taiwanese who agree that their island is part of China. That excludes President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The DPP says that the island they govern is a country in its own right, though to avoid a crisis they fudge what they mean by that. In their desire to teach Taiwanese voters that DPP rule brings pain and isolation, China has sought to ostracise the party since Ms Tsai won election in 2016. Government-to-government contacts have been limited to such technical subjects as air-traffic control, food safety and some police co-operation, for instance when one side seeks the return of a fleeing murderer. Chinese pressure is blamed for sharp declines in tourism from the mainland and in short-term exchanges by mainland students, though about 3,500 Chinese students remain in Taiwan on degree courses. Even scholars close to the DPP have been blacklisted from travel to China, among them Tseng Chien-yuan of Chung Hua University. He adds that Chinese academics he has known for decades are now barred from formal contacts with him. “I worry about this situation, because if the Chinese government only hears what it wants to know, they can never understand Taiwan,” says Mr Tseng.</p><p>China does hear from conservative supporters of the KMT, which backs closer ties with China, although not unification. About 370,000 mainlanders married to Taiwanese live on the island. Those who vote lean KMT. Equally, at any moment there are a million Taiwanese in China, including 400,000 long-term residents. Tales abound of Chinese officials offering economic rewards to Taiwanese businessmen who endorse unification.</p><p>Wang Ting-yu, a DPP legislator who sits on the parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committees, says that China’s intelligence services gather information about Taiwan from “between 10,000 and 100,000” agents and informers. Fewer than 5,000 are professional spies, he estimates. Chinese informers might be Taiwanese gangsters on the hustle in southern China, or Taiwanese businessmen looking for favours. Mr Wang cautions that China may not learn much from its spies. (Taiwan’s spooks are underwhelming when he asks about China, he notes, either because they do not trust parliamentarians or because “they don’t know anything”.)</p><p>A big danger is that ignorance leads to impatience. There are over 140 students from both sides of the straits at the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies at the University of Xiamen, a handsome port city with close geographic and cultural links to Taiwan. Chen Xiancai, a professor at the institute, says many arrive knowing little about the other side. Mainland students point to China’s strength and ask: “Why haven’t we unified yet?” His Taiwanese students retort: “Why are you in such a hurry?” The institute’s scholars stand out for their professionalism, visiting Taiwan often to conduct fieldwork. The professor leads a DPP study centre opened within the institute in 2017. But he is cautious about describing its work, saying it is focused on building a database of academic papers. Still, he is sometimes berated by online nationalists, who complain that the DPP should be “exterminated”, not studied.</p><p>Sherry Yu, a Taiwanese student in Xiamen, comes from a family that votes for the KMT. She wants a career in China but still laments that Chinese classmates—reared on jingoistic schoolbooks and censored news—cannot comprehend why Taiwanese would vote for the DPP or resist unification, insisting that they must simply want to humiliate China. Ms Yu thinks that Taiwanese just want to preserve their freedoms. When politics comes up, she often starts with “we”, then sadly finds herself using “you” and “me”.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(3,'https://www.economist.com/china/2018/07/05/a-deadline-looms-in-chinas-battle-with-foreign-firms-over-taiwan','The Economist',NULL,'A deadline looms in China’s battle with foreign firms over Taiwan','Most carriers will take the easy route and stop calling Taiwan a country',NULL,'','2018-07-05T14:57:17Z',1530802637000,'<p>WHEN it comes to asserting sovereignty over Taiwan, no fight is too small for Chinese officials.

In April China complained about an online allusion to Taiwan as a country by organisers of the Man Booker prize for fiction (they eventually chose a fudge, listing the island instead as a “country/territory”). Gap, a fashion retailer, came under fire in May for selling a T-shirt with a map of China on it that did not include Taiwan. The firm responded by withdrawing the product and promising “rigorous reviews”.</p><p>China is still doing battle with international airlines. In April its civil aviation administration, CAAC, sent a letter to 44 of them, demanding that they specify Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as being parts of China when including them in drop-down menus of countries on booking websites. Fair enough for Hong Kong and Macau, which are universally recognised as being Chinese territories. But CAAC wants Taiwan to be called “Taiwan, China”, and maps to use the same colour for both the island and the People’s Republic. That is a problem. The island calls itself an independent, sovereign state.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Originally CAAC ordered the companies to comply by May 25th. However, by that date only 18 airlines had done so, despite the authority’s hint that violators would face punishment, including fines or action against their websites. Officials extended the deadline to July 25th, saying that some airlines were experiencing “technical difficulties” updating their lists. Among those that have fallen in line are Air Canada, Air France, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. Among the latest companies to do so is Air India, which this week began calling Taiwan “Chinese Taipei”, a term acceptable to China but viewed with disdain in Taiwan, which uses it only when access to international events requires it. Holdouts include the American carriers Delta, United and American Airlines, as well as a handful of Asian ones.</p><p>China’s spat with the airlines coincides with its stepped-up efforts to put pressure on the island itself. In the past year the Chinese armed forces have staged a growing number of exercises near Taiwan, including the flying of bombers and other aircraft around it. In May it deprived Taiwan of two members of its tiny band of diplomatic partners by establishing relations with Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic (China does not allow countries to have formal ties with Taiwan and China at the same time). Apart from wanting to signal displeasure with Taiwan, which has been led since 2016 by a party whose members scorn the idea of eventual reunification, China wants to warn America’s president, Donald Trump, that he should not get too friendly with the island.</p><p>Both America and Taiwan have bristled at China’s attempt to strong-arm the airlines. The White House called it “Orwellian nonsense”. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, says it represents “a new level of hysteria” in China’s approach to how others describe Taiwan. In theory, the island should have no objection to being called “Taiwan, China”. Its official name is the Republic of China and Taiwan is technically a province of that. But it worries that the word China is usually understood to mean the Communist-ruled entity that lays claim to Taiwan. “In essence, Taiwan is a country itself,” says Mr Wu. Informally, that is the name its officials give it.</p><p>China is digging in its heels. According to Reuters, it has refused an American government request for talks about the problem. Chinese leaders may be mindful of their image at home. In the cases involving Marriott, Gap and several of the airlines, it was Chinese netizens who sounded the alarm about the firms’ categorisations of Taiwan. Chinese social media blazed with rage as nationalists excoriated the companies. Under such pressure, the government had to take action, says Xin Qiang of Fudan University in Shanghai. Mr Xin says that, as Chinese officials see it, the risk of a domestic backlash for not acting toughly outweighs that of economic or diplomatic damage resulting from feuds with other countries. Most international airlines are likely to take the route of least resistance.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/01/the-legalisation-of-gay-marriage-meets-resistance-in-taiwan','The Economist',NULL,'The legalisation of gay marriage meets resistance in Taiwan','Voters face a series of confusing referendums on the subject in late November',NULL,'','2018-11-01T16:40:21Z',1541090421000,'<p></p><p>NOWHERE IN ASIA celebrates gay pride as flamboyantly as Taipei. The annual parade in Taiwan’s capital draws tens of thousands, many from overseas. If you think near-naked men in diamanté tiaras and white go-go boots are normal for Asia—not to mention horned devils marching next to real Christian pastors—think again. Only in September did India legalise gay sex. In mainland China gay people are still often regarded as deviants. In Afghanistan sex between men is punishable by death.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Some 25 countries around the world allow same-sex marriage—but none of them is in Asia, unless you count Australia and New Zealand. Last year, however, Taipei’s parade-goers really had something to celebrate. Taiwan’s highest court had recently ruled that barring same-sex couples from marrying violated the right to be treated equally. It gave the government of President Tsai Ing-wen two years to write same-sex marriage into law.</p><p>At this year’s parade, on October 27th, the flamboyance could not conceal mounting worries. Since the court ruling, Ms Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have dithered over the needed legal changes. Ms Tsai was once outspoken in favour of marriage equality, which recommended her to younger voters. But she has since found the issue to be more polarising than she expected—and Taiwanese society has plenty of divisions already. Besides, municipal elections loom on November 24th. They will be a test of Ms Tsai’s leadership, and the DPP wants to avoid controversy. Its traditional base in the island’s south is older and more conservative, except in wanting Taiwan to declare a formal separation from China.</p><p>Anti-gay forces have seized their chance. A law passed by the DPP makes it easier to get referendums onto the ballot: voters face no fewer than ten questions on November 24th. One asks whether discussion of LGBT matters should be banned in primary and middle schools. It is intended to roll back those parts of the national curriculum that teach respect and understanding for gay students. The second asks whether voters think the civil code should define marriage as between a man and a woman. A third asks whether the rights of same-sex couples to form a permanent union should be guaranteed in a form other than civil marriage.</p><p>Gay activists have hit back with two referendums of their own—one asking whether the school curriculum should stipulate education on LGBT matters, and the other asking if same-sex rights should be enshrined in the civil code.</p><p>It is not clear how binding the results of the referendums are (they may also prove contradictory, which would be awkward). And the court has made clear that if the government does not legislate in time, same-sex couples may go ahead and marry anyway. But the conservatives’ aim is to change the climate, says Victoria Hsu of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights: teachers may grow nervous about talking about gay issues, for instance. Opponents of gay marriage would also like to get the government to institute a distinct form of marriage for gay couples, rather than amend existing marriage law. But for supporters of same-sex marriage, separate legislation for gays would be discriminatory. They liken it to America’s Jim Crow laws that once enforced racial segregation.</p><p>Other parts of Asia are watching Taiwan. Hong Kong has a vibrant civil society and growing openness to homosexuality. Since a court ruling in July the government recognises marriages of foreign same-sex couples conducted abroad for residency and other purposes. The move has the backing of businesses and law firms worried about Hong Kong’s ability to attract international talent. As in America, says Evan Wolfson, who has campaigned for marriage equality in several countries, it is likely to prove a step towards allowing same-sex couples from Hong Kong to marry.</p><p>After Hong Kong, Japan, the only G7 country that does not recognise same-sex unions, may be next. In September five foreign chambers of commerce called for marriage equality, backing calls from influential multinationals. One female lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party wrote this summer that LGBT couples were “unproductive” because they didn’t reproduce. But other ruling-party politicians are more open-minded. A growing number think the Olympic games, which Tokyo is hosting in 2020, could be a cue for Japan to come out in favour of marriage equality. That would put Japan itself on the podium.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(5,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/06/14/china-fights-taiwan-on-airline-websites','The Economist',NULL,'China fights Taiwan on airline websites','Meanwhile, America reinforces its alliance with Taiwan with bricks and mortar',NULL,'','2018-06-14T15:09:16Z',1528988956000,'<p>GIVEN all the hoopla of President Donald Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, the opening on the same day of a new American not-quite-an-embassy in Taipei was never going to hog the headlines. Yet to judge by how much Chinese officials have harangued American diplomats and congressmen about who was going to attend the ceremony in Taiwan’s capital, China appears to care every bit as much and perhaps more about America’s actions in Taiwan than about geopolitical rivalry on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>Since 1979, when America broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to open them with China, its “one-China policy” has been the bedrock of dealings with China. This means never referring to Taiwan as a country and always “acknowledging” that both China and Taiwan hold to the idea that there is but one China, even if the two sides disagree over the definition. The fudge has allowed America to enjoy close unofficial relations with Taiwan. China rarely appeared bothered by America’s unofficial representation in Taipei, known as the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). For a long time it was housed in a dingy former military building in an unprepossessing part of the city.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>The new building unveiled on June 12th, in contrast, is a design icon in the fancy district of Neihu. It cost $250m. It looks, smells and feels just like a formal embassy. Most of its nearly 500 staff are American diplomats, albeit on temporary leave from the State Department. It issues visas. The Trump administration has considered sending marines to guard it.</p><p>To China, which wants everyone to act as if Taiwan belongs to it, the new building is provocative. So, too, is a piece of legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act, passed unanimously by Congress and signed in March by Mr Trump, which encourages exchanges between American and Taiwanese officials. China has stressed that a high-level official at the opening would jeopardise talks on trade as well as co-operation over North Korea. China’s nightmare was the attendance of Mr Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton. He has called for America to “revisit” its one-China policy.</p><p>In the event, the administration kept the opening low-key, if only so as not to distract attention from the Singapore summit. The most senior American official present was Marie Royce, a mere assistant secretary of state (and also the spouse of a pro-Taiwan congressman). During the proceedings, America’s de facto ambassador, Kin Moy, bowed three times before a table laden with fruit and flowers and then lit incense. “I offer you this [building], a tangible symbol that the United States is here to stay,” Mr Moy told President Tsai Ing-wen and assembled guests. The AIT chairman, James Moriarty, described democratic Taiwan as a “model for the Indo-Pacific region” and promised continued American support for “Taiwan’s ability to defend itself”. Mr Trump has approved $1.4bn in arms sales.</p><p>China no doubt sees the building’s 99-year lease as yet another provocation. Xi Jinping, who recently awarded himself an unlimited lease on China’s presidency, insists that Taiwan’s return to the motherland cannot wait for ever. But whether China will pick a fight over Taiwan now is another matter. It is not clear that Mr Trump cares for the island, except as a pawn in trade negotiations with China. He is said to have criticised State Department speeches in support of Taiwan as complicating his dealings with Mr Xi. And he did not send Mr Bolton. Bonnie Glaser of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an American think-tank, reckons that China is getting less anxious.</p><p>Pressure only grows on Ms Tsai, however. China has put Taiwan in the doghouse since she came to office two years ago. Though she has gone out of her way not to antagonise, she will not acknowledge that Taiwan is part of China. And she has failed to condemn her prime minister, William Lai Ching-te, who has professed to be a “Taiwan independence worker”.</p><p>Official relations across the Taiwan Strait are frozen. China denies Taiwan a seat at international forums such as the World Health Organisation. It bullies international airlines and hotel groups into referring to the country as a mere region of China. In April it put on the biggest naval exercises ever carried out in the South China Sea, followed by live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait. Chinese bombers circle the island. Meanwhile, diplomatic allies peel off. In May the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso switched sides, leaving just 18 countries that recognise Taiwan.</p><p>And yet. The more China closes Taiwan’s diplomatic space, the more Ms Tsai’s creative use of unofficial diplomacy grows. Her “New Southbound Policy” attempts to forge deeper ties with South-East Asian neighbours and beyond, including those caught up in disputes with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea. (Taiwan also claims much of the sea, but is far less pushy about it.)</p><p>The scope of the policy is broad, ranging from promoting tourism to easing the plight of migrant workers to investing in manufacturing (Taiwan ranks well ahead of China in investment in Vietnam, for example). The emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region is bearing fruit. Merriden Varrall and Charlie Lyons Jones of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, say that Australia’s interest in the New Southbound Policy contrasts sharply with its wait-and-see approach to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Japan has signed a memorandum on search-and-rescue operations with Taiwan, bolstering its maritime security; intelligence-sharing may be formalised next. And Taiwanese officials are increasingly being invited to regional dialogues on the Indo-Pacific organised by think-tanks. Taiwan does not enjoy being chastised by China. But, as Ms Varrall and Mr Jones suggest, China also does not realise quite how counter-productive its approach is.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(6,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/12/01/cheered-on-by-china-taiwans-opposition-drubs-the-ruling-party','The Economist',NULL,'Cheered on by China, Taiwan’s opposition drubs the ruling party','The president’s chances of re-election look dimmer',NULL,'','2018-11-29T15:46:55Z',1543506415000,'<p></p><p>ON THE FACE of things, local elections in Taiwan on November 24th had little to do with China. Rather, they centred on disgruntlement with Tsai Ing-wen, the president, who had pushed through several controversial reforms since taking office in 2016, while dithering over some of her supporters’ most cherished causes. But the outcome, a crushing defeat for Ms Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which would like Taiwan to abjure its notional status as part of China and declare itself a distinct country, will have prompted delight on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which favours ever-closer ties with China, has been revived after a dismal performance in 2016. Ms Tsai’s hopes of re-election in 2020 are looking dimmer.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p> Before the election the DPP controlled 13 of Taiwan’s 22 counties and cities. Now the tables have been turned. The KMT will run 15 and the DPP just six. (An independent candidate appears to have won re-election as mayor of Taipei, the capital.) The DPP even lost control of its electoral stronghold, the southern city of Kaohsiung, which it had ruled for 20 years. The results seemed so calamitous that Ms Tsai felt obliged to resign as head of the DPP. Her popular prime minister also offered to resign, but she demurred. “I’m the one that needs to change,” she declared on Facebook on November 26th.</p><p>Lo Chih-cheng, a DPP lawmaker, argues that Ms Tsai took on too many reforms at once. “The president was quite idealistic, not realistic,” Mr Lo said. “She thought the more, the better.” She cut unsustainable public pensions dramatically, which alienated many civil servants. She froze and in many cases confiscated the KMT’s assets, on the grounds that it had acquired them unfairly as the governing party during nearly 40 years of authoritarian rule. She pushed through a law to phase out nuclear power by 2025, alarming industrialists who rely on cheap and stable electricity.</p><p>Moreover, Mr Lo adds, when grappling with polarising issues, Ms Tsai has sometimes angered both sides in a fruitless search for middle ground. She limited normal working hours, upsetting bosses who now have to pay more overtime, but also trimmed the number of public holidays, angering ordinary workers. She dithered about legalising gay marriage, which she had supported during her election campaign, leaving it to the courts to settle the matter. And although she enraged China by refusing to affirm that it and Taiwan are both parts of the same country, she has been careful to do nothing else to provoke it, to the ire of independence activists.</p><p>The GDP growth rate has risen during Ms Tsai’s tenure, from 1.4% in 2016 to a projected 2.7% this year. But that has not been enough to dispel a sense of economic stagnation, compounded by the abrupt contraction of tourism from China following Ms Tsai’s election. Young Taiwanese continue to emigrate to the mainland in search of greater opportunity, often lured by generous official grants. Roughly a tenth of the Taiwanese workforce now lives in China.</p><p>China makes no bones about supporting the KMT. It cut all official contact with the national government after Ms Tsai’s election, but maintained links with KMT-run cities. During the campaign it halted intimidating circular patrols around the island by its warships and military aircraft, since such shows of force tend to stir nationalist feelings among Taiwanese, boosting the DPP. The Taiwanese government accused China of spreading false rumours on social media to help the KMT. Areas where the KMT has prevailed, such as Kaohsiung, are expected to see an influx of Chinese tourists and a surge in exports of agricultural goods to China.</p><p>But Mr Lo argues that it would be a mistake to view the results as endorsement of closer ties with China. There was a referendum on the ballot that touched directly on cross-strait relations, asking whether the country should demand to be called Taiwan at the Olympics, instead of Chinese Taipei. The result was ambiguous: the proposal was rejected, but only after the Olympic authorities warned that it might lead to Taiwan’s exclusion from the Tokyo games in 2020. The DPP did not campaign in favour of the idea, which is just the sort of departure from the status quo that Ms Tsai has tried to avoid.</p><p>Moreover, the KMT is still in disarray. Its candidate in Kaohsiung, Han Kuo-yu, proved to have genuine star power. But he is an outsider, initially written off by the leadership as a no-hoper. The party has no obvious presidential candidate.</p><p> Some in the DPP even see a silver lining in the nine other referendum questions on the ballot, none of which went the party’s way. Voters approved several measures hostile to gay rights, making it tricky for the government to fulfil the supreme court’s injunction to legalise gay marriage. They also rejected Ms Tsai’s scheme to close Taiwan’s nuclear plants. But it is the DPP that champions the idea of direct democracy. The Chinese authorities, who would love one day to absorb Taiwan, must hate the precedent being set.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(7,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/04/05/taiwan-is-again-becoming-a-flashpoint-between-china-and-america','The Economist',NULL,'Taiwan is again becoming a flashpoint between China and America','Unlike tensions over trade and North Korea, it involves red lines on both sides',NULL,'','2018-04-05T14:51:07Z',1522939867000,'<p>IF THE partisanship of American politics unsettles you, take heart from a little piece of legislation that sailed through both houses of Congress with not a single vote opposed to it. And though the Taiwan Travel Act could have passed into law without a presidential signature, last month Donald Trump chose to put his cardiogrammatic scrawl to it. Given the chaos in Washington, the act reveals a remarkable consensus. It urges, though it does not mandate, high-level visits between America and Taiwan of the kind that successive administrations have discouraged, so as not to offend China.</p><p>That country’s “one-China principle” decrees that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese motherland. The Chinese government wants all other countries to act as if Taiwan belongs to it. America has never agreed to the formulation since breaking off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to establish them with China. It has made plain that Taiwan is a friend, to which it has long offered military support. But, in deference to China, American policy has never been to call Taiwan a separate country and always to “acknowledge” that both China and Taiwan agree on the principle that there is only one China, even if the two sides disagree over what exactly that means.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>This is America’s “one-China policy”. The convenient untruth, whose side-effect has been to deepen Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation, was formulated when dictatorships in both Beijing and Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, claimed to rule all of China. Taiwan has no such pretensions today. Many members of Congress have long wished to give the island more credit for its peaceful transformation into a flourishing democracy over the past three decades. The Taiwan Travel Act was born out of this. It even gets close to calling a spade a spade, and Taiwan a sovereign country: “Visits to a country by United States Cabinet members and other high-ranking officials are an indicator of the breadth and depth of ties between the United States and such country,” one clause reads. This week President Tsai Ing-wen welcomed the act’s congressional sponsors in Taipei.</p><p>More surprising is Mr Trump’s support. It is true that as president-elect in late 2016 he took a congratulatory telephone call from Ms Tsai. That set off palpitations among Washington’s China-watchers. Yet Mr Trump soon reaffirmed the one-China policy. He told a host on his favourite television channel that he would do nothing over Taiwan without first consulting the Chinese ruler, Xi Jinping. And the relationship he has subsequently developed with Mr Xi has been larded with admiration for the dictator’s power and style. Nothing Mr Trump has said or done suggests a remotely similar admiration for Taiwan.</p><p>Yet a shift of sorts is under way. In January one pro-Taiwan China hawk, Randall Schriver, was put in charge of Asia-Pacific policy at the Pentagon. A more prominent hawk, John Bolton, is about to become Mr Trump’s national security adviser. And in March Alex Wong, the official in charge of Indo-Pacific strategy at the State Department, was in Taipei to deliver a speech. Taiwan, he said, “can no longer be excluded unjustly from international fora. [It] has much to share with the world.” With Taiwan barred from everything from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to Interpol, Mr Wong has a point. He assured Ms Tsai that American support for Taiwan has never been stronger.</p><p>China is not amused, although its increased diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan since Ms Tsai’s election two years ago has surely helped galvanise the American stance. Dignitaries visiting Beijing have been told that the sort of exchanges the travel act encourages could cross a red line, and that it is therefore more dangerous than two other big challenges facing Mr Xi. The first is the delicate summitry around a nuclear North Korea. The second is the growing American assault on Chinese exports and China-first industrial policies—on April 3rd the Trump administration announced 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods, from locomotives to snowblowers (see article).</p><p>The number two at the Chinese embassy in Washington, Li Kexin, warned Mr Trump not to sign the travel act. Last year he tried bullying Congress into watering down the National Defence Authorisation Act, which empowers (but again does not require) American naval vessels to call at Taiwanese ports. “The day that a US navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People’s Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force,” he thundered at a reception in December. Last month Mr Xi himself warned that any actions to “split China” would face “the punishment of history”. Such threats are having some effect in Taiwan. Even Ms Tsai’s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party is split over how much support to give the travel act. Ms Tsai herself is instinctively cautious about upsetting China. Few Taiwanese want their country to be a pawn in a great-power game.</p><p>A test comes in the summer, when America opens a gleaming building in Taipei to house its unofficial embassy, with rumours that a member of the cabinet may attend. Mr Bolton’s presence might genuinely alarm China. Alternatively, it might interpret the Trump administration’s steps over Taiwan as a mere prop to pressure on trade. Mr Xi’s top economics official, Liu He, is in intense negotiations over China’s gaping trade surplus with America. He is presumed to have Mr Xi’s authority to offer to cut the surplus by tens of billions of dollars to avert a fully fledged trade war.</p><p>But what if China sees America as continuing to change the status quo on Taiwan after that? A few years ago Mr Xi said that the Taiwan “problem” cannot be left to future generations. Now that he has seized all the levers of power, nationalists would judge him harshly if he did not use them to stop Taiwan slipping away. So the island is shooting up the security agenda again—a reminder of the flashpoint it does not want to be, but still is.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(8,'https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/05/26/taiwans-president-has-upset-both-business-and-workers','The Economist',NULL,'Taiwan’s president has upset both business and workers','When growth is slow, it is hard for Tsai Ing-wen to please anyone',NULL,'','2018-05-26T00:00:00Z',1527292800000,'<p>LIKE a nervous candidate in a job interview, shy yet formal, she fielded questions ranging from how to handle Chinese infiltration to why she always wears trouser suits. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s usually plain-speaking president, marked her second anniversary in office with a rare live interview with a critical website.</p><p>Ms Tsai badly needs to restate her case to the people. In two years her approval ratings have slumped from almost 70% to as low as 26%, according to a broadcaster, TVBS; the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation says 48% of her compatriots disapprove of her performance, against 39% in favour. She has lost ground especially with the young, whom she has eagerly courted.</p><p>Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\'s Picks.</p><p>Elected in a landslide in 2016, Ms Tsai blazed a trail as the first female leader of a Chinese-speaking country in modern times. Her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also won a majority in Taiwan’s parliament for the first time, finally ending the grip of the Kuomintang (KMT) that began when Chiang Kai-shek and his forces fled to Taiwan from mainland China in 1949.</p><p>But her promise to revive the island’s economy, which used to be tigerish but has grown sluggish, remains unfulfilled. At the same time, tension with China has grown, despite Ms Tsai’s efforts to restrain the more radical wing of the DPP, which wants to declare formal independence, rather than maintain the current fiction that the government of Taiwan notionally represents the whole of China. Such a step, China has said, would be grounds for war.</p><p>Ms Tsai has tried to appeal both to business, in the hope of stimulating the economy, and to workers and environmentalists, the bedrock of the centre-left DPP. She has ended up pleasing neither. The DPP has promised to phase out nuclear power, but Ms Tsai allowed two shuttered reactors to restart after a big blackout last year, to the dismay of greens who object to nuclear energy despite its minimal greenhouse-gas emissions. In the name of workers’ rights, she issued new rules on working hours, which companies denounced as unduly rigid. When she modified them somewhat, unions howled.</p><p>Wages are barely higher than 15 years ago (see chart), largely because of increasing competition from manufacturers in China and elsewhere, which has left Taiwanese employers with little leeway to increase salaries. Many frustrated young university graduates have left the country in search of better opportunities. Ms Tsai has raised the monthly minimum wage by 10%, to NT$22,000 ($733). This year she also increased civil servants’ pay by 3%. Yet on May 1st thousands of workers took to the streets, waving banners reading “Fight for a higher salary”.</p><p>Taiwan has one of the lowest levels of foreign investment in Asia, points out William Foreman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. Ms Tsai’s government has given tax breaks to angel investors. She has also tried to pare regulation, giving firms more leeway to experiment with financial services, for example. And she has identified five industries in which she thinks Taiwanese firms can compete internationally: defence, biotechnology, clean energy, the internet of things and smart machinery—although only the last of these, notes Stephen Su of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, is currently a significant earner for local businesses.</p><p>Economic growth has picked up, from 1% year-on-year in the quarter in which Ms Tsai took office to 3% in the first quarter of this year. But workers are not feeling the benefit. Other reforms, however, have bitten. The government’s (much needed) cuts to pensions for civil servants and teachers prompted big demonstrations. Last month hundreds of veterans scuffled with police and threw smoke-bombs to protest against plans to cut military pensions too.</p><p>On social issues Ms Tsai has wobbled. Before she was elected she put out a video supporting gay marriage. But once in power, the DPP backed away and dithered. In the end it was the constitutional court that ruled in favour of gay marriage a year ago, instructing parliament to enact the necessary laws. It has not yet done so. That has left young people disillusioned, says Jason Hsu, a KMT lawmaker, who believes gay marriage was one of the main reasons Ms Tsai captured the youth vote.</p><p>Ms Tsai also promised to provide a proper accounting of the human-rights abuses committed during the KMT’s long, harsh dictatorship, and to remove all monuments glorifying this era. But she has appointed a former member of a watchdog agency under the previous KMT administration to head the committee in charge of this project. This has upset some in her own party. Meanwhile, a law that strips the KMT of wealth deemed ill-gotten has infuriated the opposition.</p><p>The KMT is still reeling from its defeat in 2016 and the legislative setbacks that followed. Its leadership is weak. But Ms Tsai faces opposition of a different sort. Two ex-presidents (one from the DPP and one from the KMT) and many prominent politicians, especially within the DPP, want her to permit a referendum on independence—something that would provoke a dire response from China. She is resisting, while counting on an economic upturn to bolster her fortunes. “We’ve spent most of my first two years in preparation, including legal preparation, so in my presidency’s next two years we will speed up the pace of implementation,” she said in her online interview. But time flies.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL);

Over the course of his nearly 30-year career, the Taiwanese film-maker’s work has moved further and further towards the “temple” end of the spectrum. Often bracketed under the “slow cinema” movement, he is a master of the very long take. His last feature, 2013’s Stray Dogs, included a shot of two people staring at a mural in an abandoned building that lasted over 14 minutes. But despite his shaven head, Tsai is no monk. In the past, his films have featured choreographed musical sequences, surreal comedy, and plenty of sex – gay, straight, solo, even watermelon-incorporating, in the case of 2005’s The Wayward Cloud.</p><p>In person, he is unassuming and quick to laugh. “In the past I really cared if people understood my films, but when you grow older, you care less,” says Tsai, who turned 61 last year. “You want to do something to please yourself. I feel like the film industry has trapped film-makers. They tell you you need to have a narrative structure, you need to do things a certain way. They limit the imaginations of film-makers. I often think about, what is the meaning of film? What does film want to say? The simple thing is, film is about images.”</p><p>After Stray Dogs, which won a host of international awards, Tsai claimed he was giving up commercial cinema altogether, but few could have anticipated where he would go next: virtual reality. The Deserted is possibly Tsai’s most contemplative work yet. Free of dialogue and narrative, it is set in a derelict, overgrown apartment block in the Taiwanese countryside, occupied by a man with neck pains, and what could be the ghosts of his mother and wife, and a large, white pet fish. The viewer becomes an invisible spectator to this surreal domestic tableau. The action is unhurried but never dull to look at, and you can always swivel round on your chair to appreciate the stained concrete walls, the puddles on the floor and the lush greenery outside the pane-less windows.</p><p>Tsai is one of the most consistent auteurs cinema has ever known, and aficionados will recognise many of his trademarks in The Deserted: the man is Tsai’s regular actor Lee Kang-sheng – whom he first cast in 1991, and has not made a film without since; derelict buildings and water also frequently feature in his work. Ghosts, too: in Goodbye, Dragon Inn, the living and the dead communed in a condemned Taipei cinema (screening King Hu’s 1967 martial arts classic Dragon Inn). Lee’s neck pain was also a theme in 1997’s The River. The white fish was also seen in 2001’s What Time Is It There? when the mother believed it to be the reincarnated spirit of her dead husband. The Deserted is a film full of ghosts, and thanks to virtual reality, the viewer becomes another one.</p><p>“I’m a Buddhist,” says Tsai. “When I enter a new space, especially ruins or an abandoned place, I often say hello and have a little chat. I always feel there is someone there, a fairy, ghost or spirit.” The Mandarin title of The Deserted translates as The Home at Lan Re Temple, Tsai explains, which comes from a Chinese ghost story. “The Lan Re temple in Buddhism is actually a space for all the spirits to gather around. This is their space.” The Deserted was shot next door to the abandoned building where Tsai and Lee moved five years ago, to get back to nature and help Lee’s recovery after a stroke and a mystery recurring illness (the neck pain is real). Another recent film, Afternoon, also shot in an abandoned building nearby, is a conversation between the two men, about their long relationship, personal and professional.</p><p>“Through film-making, I have discovered the concept of time,” Tsai says. Having worked with the same subjects and casts for decades, his films have become a way of capturing the ghosts of the past and tracking time’s passage, whether in the face of Lee or the landscapes of rapidly developing Taiwan.</p><p>Tsai, born in Malaysia, came to Taiwan as a student in 1985 when the country was still under martial law. That ended two years later, and Tsai became part of a new wave of renowned Taiwanese film-makers, including Ang Lee, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang. They didn’t just benefit from Taiwan’s liberalisation, they helped make it happen, Tsai explains. “Me and many other film-makers were fighting the system, trying to make it more open. If you look at Asia now, Taiwan is the most open-minded and welcoming to all ways of film-making.”</p><p>Tsai never stopped making films after Stray Dogs, he says; he just found other ways to do it, and different places to show them. Where his contemporaries have struggled to compete with Hollywood and Chinese blockbusters in the “shopping mall”, Tsai has turned to museums and art galleries to show his work. “Many people tell me I should have disappeared a long time ago,” he laughs. But instead, to his surprise, he has found new viewers. “In Asia right now, my audiences are more people in their teens and 20s than people of my generation,” he says. “Maybe it’s because they are the internet generation, they see so much information every day. So when they experience my films they maybe feel something different. They have no baggage about ‘what is film?’”</p><p>As well as honouring cinema’s past, perhaps Tsai’s meditative works points the way to its future.</p><p>• A retrospective of Tsai Ming-Liang’s films, curated by the director himself, and including the UK premiere of The Deserted (4-8 April), is part of of the UK Taiwan film festival, from 3-14 April.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(2,'https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/27/taiwanese-game-removed-from-sale-after-anti-china-messages-discovered','The Guardian',NULL,'\nTaiwanese game removed from sale after anti-China messages discovered\n','\n\nMentions of game including hidden message comparing Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh also scrubbed from social media site Weibo\n',NULL,'\nPatrick Lum','2019-02-27T12:56:47+0000',1551272207000,'<p>Taiwanese horror game Devotion has been removed from sale globally, following a backlash after a hidden message referencing Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie-the-Pooh was discovered in-game.</p><p>Devotion, by the Taiwanese indie developer Red Candle Games, was released on 19 February and was initially popular among horror enthusiasts.

The characters on the corners are homonyms for internet slang that means roughly “your mum is stupid” or “you’re an idiot”.</p><p>The game was initially removed from sale in China on the popular PC gaming platform Steam, and is now unavailable in all territories. The developers have confirmed that they have removed the game from the store temporarily for an internal technical review, as well as to confirm that no other hidden messages remain.</p><p>Discussion of the game has been banned or removed on many popular Chinese social media sites such as Weibo. It is unclear if this is a government direction or pre-emptive self-censorship.</p><p>Devotion and Red Candle’s previous game, Detention, have also received a slew of negative reviews by users – possibly targets of a review-bombing campaign. Many reviews reference other alleged inferences that are derogatory towards Chinese people, such as a cult leader named Lu Gongmin, a homophone for “mainland citizen”, in a related marketing campaign.</p><p>The developer has apologised on 23 February and removed the politically sensitive materials in an updated version of Devotion, explaining that prototype materials containing internet memes were unintentionally not removed before launch.</p><p>“This is purely an accident, and we have no intention for causing harm nor hatred,” the apology reads. “Red Candle Games take full responsibility…”</p><p>The game’s Chinese partners, Indievent and Winking Entertainment, have severed relations with the developer.</p><p>On 23 February, Chen Chi-mai, Taiwan’s vice premier, praised the game in a Facebook post, saying “only in countries with democracy and freedom can creation be free from restrictions”.</p><p>Taiwanese pro-independence sentiment remains controversial in China. Last year, film director Fu Yue was censored in China after mentioning Taiwanese independence in an acceptance speech at the Taipei Golden Horse awards, a festival and awards programme founded by the Taiwanese government. Chinese gamers are concerned about the possibility of tighter censorship on Steam, and other popular games such as Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, which are technically available in the PRC but have not been approved by government regulators and could be banned at any time. Last week, Variety reported that China has stopped accepting applications for video games licences due to a backlog.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(3,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/21/taiwan-proposes-asia-first-draft-law-on-lgbt-same-sex-marriage','The Guardian',NULL,'\nTaiwan proposes Asia’s first draft law on marriage equality\n','\n\nThe legislation would give same-sex couples similar legal protections for marriage\n',NULL,'Reuters','2019-02-21T10:42:38+0000',1550745758000,'<p>Taiwan has proposed a draft law to allow same-sex marriage, but rights activists and conservative groups criticised the legislation, Asia’s first such bill, amid a heated debate over marriage equality.</p><p>Voters opposed same-sex marriage in a series of referendums late last year, defining marriage as between a man and a woman and asking for a special law to be enacted for same-sex unions.</p><p>The draft law unveiled by cabinet on Thursday would give same-sex couples similar legal protections for marriage as heterosexuals, but marriage in civil law would remain defined as between a man and woman.</p><p>The premier, Su Tseng-chang, said the bill respected the referendum results, but activists had said a separate law for same-sex marriage was discriminatory.</p><p>“Controversies are expected about the proposal, but I really hope our homosexual friends can wait a bit longer,” Su said.</p><p>“This might fall short of expectations, but after all it’s a start.”</p><p>Jennifer Lu, coordinator of Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan, said the draft did not give complete legal protection to same-sex couples.

Justices told legislators then to make same-sex marriage legal within two years, a first for Asia, where religion and conservative governments normally keep the bans in place.Although the ballot is advisory only, it is expected to frustrate lawmakers mindful of public opinion as they face the court deadline next year. Many legislators will stand for re-election in 2020.“The legislature has lots of choices on how to make this court order take effect,” said referendum proponent Chen Ke, a Catholic pastor in Taiwan and an opponent of same-sex marriage.Ruling party lawmakers backed by president Tsai Ing-wen had proposed legalising same-sex marriage in late 2016, but put aside their ideas to await the court hearing. Opposition to same-sex marriage crested after the court ruling. Opponents have held rallies and mobilised votes online.Courts will still consider local marriage-licensing offices in violation of the law if they refuse same-sex couples until May 2019, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said last week.“The referendum is a general survey, it doesn’t have very strong legal implications,” said Shiau Hong-chi, a professor of gender studies and communications management at Shih-Hsin University in Taiwan. “One way or another it has to go back to the court.”Voters approved a separate measure on Saturday calling for a “different process” to protect same-sex unions. It is viewed as an alternative to using the civil code. A third initiative, also approved, asked that schools avoid teaching LGBT “education”.Amnesty International told the government it needed to “deliver equality and dignity”.“This result is a bitter blow and a step backwards for human rights in Taiwan,” Amnesty’s Taiwan-based acting director, Annie Huang, said. “However, despite this setback, we remain confident that love and equality will ultimately prevail.”Taiwanese also elected candidates from the China-friendly opposition Nationalist party to a majority of mayoral and county magistrate posts, reversing the party’s losses in 2014.</p><p>China welcomed the defeat of Taiwan’s pro-independence ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) at the local elections, saying it showed people wanted peaceful relations with Beijing.</p><p>The vote dealt a major blow to President Tsai Ing-wen’s hopes of re-election in 2020, forcing her to quit as DPP leader as the Beijing-friendly main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) made gains in the face of China’s increasing pressure on the island.</p><p>The DPP has been left in control of only six of Taiwan’s cities and counties, compared with at least 15 for the KMT.

However, anti-gay groups have led their supporters to believe they can stop gay marriage, which is ridiculous.</p><p>“They have spent a lot on spreading fear, misinformation and homophobic rhetoric. If they are successful in getting more votes, they will try to push our government to pass a lightweight act compared with the civil code.”</p><p>Ying-Chao Kao, assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, says the conservative forces have roughly 10 times more money and resources than the pro-LGBT campaign.</p><p>“In the past six months, the conservative campaigns have produced fear, anxiety, depression and moral panic,” he says. “There were two LGBT members who committed suicide before the referendum.

However, the most important determinant factor will be voter turnout.”</p><p>The issue is divided along generational rather than political lines and, with Taiwan lowering the voting age for the first time in a referendum from 20 to 18, the LGBT campaign will be looking to the urban youth to come out in force.</p><p>According to a July survey conducted by the Marriage Equality Coalition, more than 80% of the population below the age of 35 supports same-sex marriage, compared with 30% of over 45s.</p><p>Kao says: “These young people have been educated about LGBT issues and have greater exposure to the community.

But after conservative groups rallied against the change, the government announced a referendum on the issue in August.</p><p>As voting day nears, conservative groups have deployed a reported budget of 100m Taiwan dollars (£2.5m) in an effort to push the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman only. The group Alliance for Next Generation’s Happiness, which gathered enough signatures to trigger the referendum, voiced fears for society, with spokesman Tseng Hsien-ying saying: “The collapse of the family system will deal a huge blow to society.”</p><p>Advertisements have blanketed Taiwan’s airwaves and newspapers. Misinformation has spread on social media, with same-sex marriage opponents claiming marriage equality would affect the island’s falling birthrate and make it a haven for foreigners with HIV who seek to use the national health system.</p><p>On the other side, a range of celebrities and 27 major corporations, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, have supported calls for same-sex marriage. About 100,000 people attended a rally in support of marriage equality a week before the vote in Taipei, according to local media. But polling suggests equality advocates may have a tough time at the polls. About 77% support defining marriage as between one man and one woman, according to the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation.</p><p>Taiwan had been set to become the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage when the island’s highest court said in May 2017 that barring gay couples from marrying violated “the people’s freedom of marriage” and “the people’s right to equality”.</p><p>“Sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic that is resistant to change,” the court said in its ruling. “The freedom of marriage for two persons of the same sex, once legally recognised, will constitute the collective basis, together with opposite-sex marriage, for a stable society.”</p><p>The ruling required same-sex marriage to be legalised within two years. While some form of legal recognition for same-sex couples is inevitable given the court’s ruling, conservatives hope to limit it to civil partnerships rather than amending the civil code on marriage.</p><p>As part of the reforms last year to increase participation in policy making among ordinary citizens, the government made it easier to propose referendums, lowering the number of signatures required to 280,000 signatures – equivalent to 1.5% of the electorate.</p><p>The situation has lead to a confusing ballot on Saturday, with a total of five questions related to same-sex life on the island, two with language in favour and three opposed.

By turns galumphing and graceful, the roughly £260m hulk contains an opera house, concert hall, theatre and recital hall, seating up to 7,000 people within its curvaceous shell. As Taiwan faces ever more pressure for assimilation from mainland China, whose cultural building boom has led to a new museum or concert hall open practically every week in recent years, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts, AKA Weiwuying, is a monumental statement that this plucky nation means business on the international cultural stage.</p><p>Gaping openings in the building’s hefty flanks beckon you into a cave-like landscape, where the floor rides up in great waves as the ceiling plunges down to meet the ground, forming a world of tunnels and canyons. The glossy-white steel skin is sliced open in places, bringing shafts of light into the space and offering intriguing glimpses of the venues within. It provides cooling respite from the tropical heat of this coastal city, channelling the breeze beneath its bulging belly to make a welcome place for picnics, tai-chi, yoga classes and some exhilarating swings.</p><p>“We were struck by the informality of the performing arts in Taiwan,” says Dutch architect Francine Houben, whose practice, Mecanoo (designers of the Birmingham Library), won the competition for the project in 2007. “Chinese opera has its origins in street theatre, so we wanted to make a place that would feel as casual and informal as going to see a performance in the park.”</p><p>The venue’s ambience is more that of a leisure centre than an opera house, particularly compared with Taipei’s national theatre and concert hall, each built in 1987, which stand on either side of the capital’s central square, like a pair of regal temples from the Forbidden City. By contrast, Weiwuying’s artistic director, Chien Wen-Pin, hopes people will spill into its theatres from the park, and treat it as their living room. “We had over 50,000 people turn up to our open day,” he says. “People occupied the space in a way were weren’t planning or expecting, taking their shoes off, doing exercise, lying in the shade, even breaking into song as they entered the concert hall.”</p><p>Featuring the largest organ in Asia, designed as two thickets of bamboo with more than 9,000 pipes, the concert hall is a swirling symphony of oak and champagne-coloured seats, with a 22-tonne acoustic reflector dangling ominously from the ceiling. Despite its 2,000-person capacity, it feels surprisingly intimate, the furthest seat being 30 metres from the conductor. The Parisian magician of acoustics, Albert Xu, built a 1:10 model of it to ensure it provides the perfect reverberation time for everything from a classical orchestra to the twanging of the Taiwanese aboriginal mouth harp. He also worked his magic on the other three spaces, each designed with a distinct character and calibrated to accommodate a variety of art forms.</p><p>The 434-seat recital hall has an asymmetrical seating layout, “so more people can see the pianists’ fingers”, say the architects, while its panelled walls can rotate to provide different levels of absorption, whether it’s hosting harsher classical Chinese music or jazz, or softer baroque chamber music. The playhouse, with deep blue seats, can accommodate an orchestra to the side of the stage (important for Chinese opera, where there must be a direct line of sight between the musicians and performers). Meanwhile, the deep red 2,236-seat opera house enjoys a humungous backstage, four times the size of the auditorium, conceived as a “theatre machine” that can contain the scenery and equipment for five different shows at once. “It’s even bigger and better equipped than Beijing’s opera,” Houben whispers conspiratorially about an important point of national pride.</p><p>If the auditoria are exemplars of their kind, then the circulation and foyer space between them feels a little like an afterthought. With the four ovoid venues set in a rectangular volume stretching 225 metres long by 160 metres wide, there is a lot of leftover space, mainly decked out with acres of grey carpet, plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, every surface painted black or white, giving it a rather bleak, monotonous feeling. Within the building there is little of the spatial drama promised by the undulating plaza outside. Instead, it has the air of a deep-plan office block with theatrical ambitions.</p><p>The architects are quick to point out that the budget is actually very tight for a project of this scale, which necessitated some of the prosaic fittings. While Jean Nouvel’s Philharmonie de Paris cost £340m, and Herzog & de Meuron’s Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg was a whopping £690m (each housing a single auditorium), Mecanoo has provided four theatres in one for a fraction of the price.</p><p>The robust, rough-and-ready quality is also somehow appropriate for the nature of this no-nonsense port city. “We wanted it to have the detailing of a cargo ship, not a luxury yacht,” says Houben, referring to the visible steel welding joints between the panels of the building’s billowing white hull. Those who aren’t told of the container ship allusion might just think it is badly finished, but various nautical markings reinforce the seafaring air.</p><p>The bigger question is if this city of three million, which has enjoyed a single 1,600-capacity theatre until now, has the ability to fill such an enormous complex on a regular basis. The director of the £106m National Taichung theatre, another ambitious cave-like opera house, an hour away by train and built by Toyo Ito in 2015, admits it is struggling to sell tickets to its current run of Wagner’s Siegfried, after the novelty of the venue’s opening has worn off. Taipei, meanwhile, awaits the opening of its long-delayed £133m performing arts centre designed by OMA, another theatre, concert hall and blackbox auditorium combined in a thrilling multilayered transformer of a building.</p><p>It is an extraordinary abundance of venues for one country to be opening in the span of a few years, all planned in the mid-2000s by different regional and national administrations. As China picks off Taiwan’s allies with dollar diplomacy (only 17 countries now recognise the island as independent, thereby disqualifying themselves from formal relations with China), it seems as if cultural diplomacy is one of the few weapons it has left.</p><p>If the palpable level of excitement in Kaohsiung on the opening night of Weiwuying last week is anything to go by – when tens of thousands gathered in the park for a spectacular gala performance staged on the building’s outdoor amphitheatre, complete with an aerial ballet of drones – there’s an eager population waiting to fill its great halls with life.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(14,'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/air-pollution-linked-to-greater-risk-of-mouth-cancer-finds-study','The Guardian',NULL,'\nAir pollution linked to greater risk of mouth cancer, finds study\n','\n\nResearch in Taiwan has show a link between very high levels of air pollution and oral cancer\n',NULL,'\nNicola Davis','2018-10-09T23:30:31+0100',1539124231000,'<p>High levels of air pollution are linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer, new research has revealed.</p><p>Scientists have previously linked high air pollution to a host of health problems, from an increased risk of dementia to asthma and even changes in the structure of the heart, with recent research suggesting there is no “safe level” of air pollution.</p><p>Now researchers say that at very high levels of air pollution, the risk of developing mouth cancer appears to rise.</p><p>Writing in the Journal of Investigative Medicine, researchers in Taiwan describe how they discovered the association by looking at air pollution data from 66 air quality monitoring stations around the country collected in 2009, and combing this with data from the health records of more than 480,000 men aged 40 and over from 2012/13. In total, there were 1,1617 cases of mouth cancer among participants.</p><p>The team focused on tiny particulates of pollution known as PM2.5s, and took the men’s exposure to this air pollution as being based on where they lived. They then sorted the participants into four groups, from lowest to highest levels of exposure.</p><p>After taking into account factors including age, exposure to ozone, levels of other particulates, age, smoking status and whether the men chewed betel quid – a mixture of ingredients that includes areca nut and betel leaf and is known to increase the risk of mouth cancer – the researchers found that men exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5s had an increased risk of mouth cancer.</p><p>Air pollution has previously been linked with several types of cancer</p><p>Compared with men exposed to average annual PM2.5 levels of 26.74 micrograms (μg) per cubic metre (m3) of air, those exposed to concentrations of 40.37 μg/m3 or higher had 43% greater odds of developing the disease.</p><p>“The mechanism through which this occurs is not clearly understood, hence further investigations are required,” the researchers write.</p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has previously said average annual levels of PM2.5s should not exceed 10 μg/m3. While in central London the average annual figures have been found to be double this, they are still far lower than the highest levels seen in the Taiwanese study.</p><p>However, many other cities around the world have extremely high levels of air pollution. According to figures from the WHO, the average annual level of PM2.5s in Kabul is 86 μg/m3, while in Beijing it is 85 μg/m3 and in Delhi it has been recorded at 122 μg/m3.</p><p>But the study has limitations, including that it is does not consider the men’s previous exposure to air pollution over their lifetime – which may have been higher or lower than their recent exposure.</p><p>Prof Frank Kelly, chair in environmental health at King’s College London, who was not involved in the study, said it would be useful to explore whether a link between mouth cancer and air pollution is seen in other countries.</p><p>“Air pollution has previously been linked with several types of cancer, including breast, liver, lung and pancreatic cancer. It is therefore not surprising that this new study in Taiwan has made a possible link with mouth cancer,” he said. “However, given that air pollution concentrations and smoking incidence are much lower in the UK and we don’t chew betel all suggest that the increased risk of developing mouth cancer may be unique to Taiwan.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(15,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/29/keir-starmer-visits-taiwan-to-lobby-against-death-penalty','The Guardian',NULL,'\nKeir Starmer visits Taiwan to lobby against death penalty\n','\n\nLabour frontbencher and former DPP will meet senior judiciary and politicians\n',NULL,'\nOwen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent','2018-09-29T10:05:34+0100',1538211934000,'<p>Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, will fly out to Taiwan this weekend to lobby against the death penalty in an initiative also aimed at demonstrating the UK’s continued commitment to international legal standards following the EU referendum.</p><p>His four-day trip, which is supported by the Foreign Office, will include meetings with the country’s vice-president, minister of justice and senior judiciary.

One of the most important points to emphasise after the referendum is the UK’s continued commitment to international law … across the world.</p><p>“For me personally, and the country, compliance with international human rights obligations has always been central and I have devoted much of my career to that cause ... Going to Taiwan is part of maintaining the UK’s commitment to international human rights.”</p><p>Saul Lehrfreund, a solicitor at the London law firm Simons Muirhead & Burton and co-founder of the Death Penalty Project, is accompanying Starmer to Taiwan. He said: “We will be raising the case of Lee. Taiwan has not said it will abolish the death penalty tomorrow, but has stated that it’s a long-term objective.”</p><p>Lehrfreund has also been to talk to authorities in China about the death penalty. Chinese executions have declined in number: 25 years ago as many 25,000 prisoners were being killed every year. The current figure is believed to be roughly 3,000 executions.</p><p>“The reality is that miscarriages of justice are inevitable anywhere in the world. An individual on death row in Taiwan was exonerated recently after spending 10 years on death row.”</p><p>The UK’s commitment to opposing the death penalty has been questioned since the government signalled in July that it may allow two terror suspects, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, who have been detained in Iraq, to be extradited to the US, where they could face the death penalty. </p><p>The Foreign Office said: “It is a longstanding policy of the UK government to oppose the death penalty, in all circumstances, as a matter of principle.”</p><p>The department said it worked closely, through the Magna Carta Fund, with abolitionist organisations such as the Death Penalty Project to reduce the number of executions and restrict use of the death penalty.</p><p>Asked about the Isis suspects, the spokesperson said: “We are clear that any foreign fighters who may be captured in an armed conflict should be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and brought to justice in accordance with legal due process.”</p><p>Starmer is due to return to the UK on Thursday after the end of the Conservative party conference. In an article he and Lehfreund have written for Taiwanese papers, they said: “The global experience shows that support for capital punishment dwindles after abolition as the punishment comes to be outdated.</p><p>“There are many unanswered questions about Lee’s death that make it sit so uncomfortably with a commitment towards abolition, including that his original sentence of life imprisonment was increased to death on appeal, the lingering and serious concerns as to Lee’s mental health and his apparent unwillingness to appeal or seek clemency … It has been made repeatedly clear that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(16,'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/22/vatican-and-china-sign-agreement-on-bishop-appointments','The Guardian',NULL,'\nVatican and China sign agreement on bishop appointments\n','\n\nHistoric accord was announced during Pope Francis’s visit to Lithuania\n',NULL,'Reuters in Vilnius','2018-09-22T12:04:55+0100',1537614295000,'<p>The Vatican and China have signed a historic provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops.</p><p>The agreement was signed in Beijing and announced while Pope Francis was visiting Lithuania at the start of a four-day trip to the Baltic countries.</p><p>The Vatican said the accord was “not political, but pastoral”.</p><p>China cut off diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951.

It has repeatedly flexed its muscles to strong-arm other nations out of maintaining separate diplomatic ties with the two entities: administrations can deal with China or Taiwan, not both.</p><p>It has also recently sought to intimidate Taiwan through demonstrations of military might and to alienate it commercially, insisting foreign companies list the territory as a region of China on their websites as a condition of doing business with the mainland.</p><p>Many Taiwanese have expressed disquiet about their province’s economic dependence on China and the latter’s suspected attempts at interfering in its free elections. The Sunflower Movement was duly formed in 2014 to protest Chinese encroachment over its autonomy.</p><p>Taipei’s separatist president, Tsai Ing-wen, said this week China must “face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan” and “respect the insistence of 23m people on freedom and democracy”.</p><p>What is Taiwan’s history?</p><p>The first recorded visit of Chinese explorers to the island relates to 239 AD but Taiwan only came to be administered by the mainland when it was annexed by the Qing dynasty in 1683, prior to which it had briefly been a Dutch colony.</p><p>During the Qing era, Han migrants from Fujian and Guangdong arrived to set up home in Taiwan, crossing the strait to liberate themselves from rural poverty in those provinces.</p><p>In 1895, China was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War and control of the island was surrendered to Tokyo. Fifty years later, the fall of Japan in the Second World War in turn allowed China to regain its former authority.</p><p>When the ousted Chiang and his Kuomintang (KMT) acolytes arrived in 1945, they took control of Taiwan and ran the territory as the Republic of China in exile, an effective dictatorship, provoking deep resentment from the locals. They intended to use it as a base from which to retake their former homeland, a hope dashed after the UN officially recognised Mao’s People’s Republic as the true China in 1971.</p><p>The exile’s son, Chiang Cing-kuo, subsequently began the process of democratisation. By the end of the 1970s, relations with China had improved and mutual restrictions on travel and investment were relaxed, even though Taiwan had snubbed the mainland’s overtures on reunification. </p><p>It was at this juncture that Taiwan emerged as an industrial powerhouse, enjoying rapid economic growth and establishing itself as a manufacturing hub, specialising in tech and electronics for global export.</p><p>Its first non-KMT leader, Chen Shui-bian, was elected in 2000 and his open support for an independent Taiwan did much to sour the peace.</p><p>The more moderate Ma Ying-jeo’s victory eight years later provided Beijing with a more palatable alternative but Ms Tsai’s assent to power in 2016 as head of the Democratic Progressive Party once more drew the issue of Taiwanese independence into the spotlight.</p><p>US president Donald Trump called Ms Tsai to congratulate her on her victory, breaking with American foreign policy in place since the Jimmy Carter administration in 1979, risking the ire of Xi Jinping.</p><p>By making the call, Mr Trump implicitly acknowledged (intentionally or by accident) Taiwan’s sovereignty and President Tsai’s status as a head of state and world leader, in defiance of China.</p><p>The US remains Taiwan’s biggest ally but walks a difficult tightrope, respecting China by not overtly stating its preference for a free Taiwan while simultaneously honouring the bond forged with the island during the Pacific campaign of the Second World War by offering “defensive” military support in the event Taipei should come under attack.</p><p>How serious is President Xi’s statement?</p><p>China’s president stressed his ambitions for Taiwan were in the greater interests of national security and centred around “peaceful reunification”.</p><p>“China won’t attack Chinese people. We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”, he said.</p><p>But despite the broadly conciliatory tone, he refused to rule out a military conquest: “We will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.”</p><p>“We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means... The issue of Taiwan is part of China’s domestic politics and foreign interference is intolerable.”</p><p>Mr Xi’s proposal for unification is a one-country, two-system framework akin to that seen in Hong Kong since Britain handed over sovereignty to China in 1997. Such a deal would respect the Taiwanese social system and way of life and guarantee their property rights, religious beliefs and other rights, he said. </p><p>But similar pledges concerning the future of Hong Kong have not prevented Beijing tightening its grip on the city, with activists voicing fears about growing pressure on democratic freedoms.</p><p>For her part, President Tsai responded to her counterpart’s remarks by rejecting the Hong Kong model, calling on China to respect Taiwanese sovereignty, leaving the matter in its customary stalemate.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(3,'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taiwan-us-china-president-tasi-ing-wen-visit-houston-trump-a8499006.html','INDEPEDENT',NULL,'China enraged as Taiwan president’s US visit shows growing support in Congress ','United States has not officially recognised Taiwan since 1979 but relations between Washington and Taipei appear to be strengthening\n',NULL,'Chris Horton','2018-08-20T10:21:56+01:00',1534756916000,'<p>President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan visited Houston over the weekend, her second brief stop in the United States in one week, a sign of efforts to deepen relations between Washington and Taipei despite vehement opposition from China.</p><p>Ms Tsai stopped in Los Angeles last Monday, on her way to Paraguay and Belize, and then in Houston on Saturday on her way back home. During the earlier stop, she met with three California lawmakers, including one, Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat, who called on the United States to formally invite her to Washington, which would break with decades of American practice.</p><p>The United States has not officially recognised Taiwan since 1979, when it shifted to recognising China’s communist government. China hopes to absorb the self-governed, democratic island, which it has never controlled, and has campaigned to erase any recognition by other countries or corporations of Taiwan’s sovereignty.</p><p>The visits to Houston and Los Angeles are considered “transit stops” rather than official visits, part of a long-standing restriction imposed by the United States to maintain better relations with China. But Beijing has objected even to such brief stop-overs, and the most recent ones came after President Donald Trump demonstrated willingness to provoke China’s anger.</p><p>Mr Trump has imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, touching off a trade war, and in March he signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the kind of high-level, official visits the United States and Taiwan have not had in many years. Ms Tsai’s most recent transit stops were her first since Mr Trump signed the act into law.</p><p>While there were no expectations that Mr Trump would meet his Taiwanese counterpart, there were small indications that the United States was willing to be more welcoming to Taiwanese presidents.</p><p>In a first, Taiwanese journalists were permitted to follow Ms Tsai and report from the sites of events she attended. She visited Taiwan’s de facto consulate in Los Angeles – another first – and she addressed American media at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Los Angeles.</p><p>“There were pictures of her meeting crowds of local Taiwanese, accompanied by police escort, and giving a speech at the Reagan library,” said Julian Ku, professor at Hofstra Law School. “All of that significantly raised her public profile and made her seem more like a normal leader making a normal visit to a foreign country.”</p><p>She met with Republican and Democratic members of Congress, underscoring the strong bipartisan support for Taiwan.</p><p>In China, however, Ms Tsai elicits hateful commentary on a level that perhaps only the Dalai Lama can match. Shortly after she visited a Los Angeles location of the Taiwanese coffee chain 85C, the Chinese internet erupted with anger, calling for a boycott of the chain’s several hundred locations in China, its largest market.</p><p>That day, 85C’s parent company, Gourmet Master, whose stock trades on Taiwan’s exchange, lost $120 million in share value. The company promptly apologised and expressed support for peaceful unification.</p><p>Many Taiwanese were upset by the company caving in to Chinese pressure, with some also calling for a boycott of the chain. Polls consistently show that the overwhelming majority of people in Taiwan, a multiparty democracy, oppose being absorbed into China’s one-party, authoritarian rule.</p><p>The episode is the latest example of the Chinese government using its grip on the country’s enormous market to pressure corporations into serving its political agenda. In recent months, companies including international airlines, hotels and other brands have begun referring to Taiwan as a province of China in response to threats from Beijing. The White House called China’s tactics “Orwellian nonsense,” but did little else to back up American corporations.</p><p>If China fines US companies or restricts their access to Chinese markets for refusing to call Taiwan a province, then the Trump administration should retaliate in kind against Chinese companies, said William Stanton, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial US diplomatic presence there.</p><p>“China’s trying to make both Taiwan and the government of Tsai Ing-wen persona non grata throughout the world,” he said. “There’s just no end to it.”</p><p>Bonnie Glaser, senior Asia adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Trump administration’s approval for Ms Tsai’s visits to the Reagan library and the Johnson Space Centre in Houston showed that “they trusted she would not say or do anything that would increase cross-strait tensions.”</p><p>Congress, which has been a staunch supporter of Taiwan since the United States broke formal ties almost four decades ago, has become increasingly open to taking a new approach toward Taiwan.</p><p>“I think at some point we’re going to have to recognise the independence of Taiwan,” Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a July speech at the American Enterprise Institute.</p><p>Earlier this year, Mr Ku of Hofstra Law School was one of several experts who testified at a House hearing on strengthening relations with Taiwan.</p><p>“I think there is an appetite in Congress to do more for Taiwan, and that the opposition to China in Congress is allowing pro-Taiwan congressmen to think bigger about how to help Taiwan,” he said.</p><p>Congress has limited direct powers over US foreign policy, but inviting foreign leaders to address it is one authority it has exercised, with or without presidential approval.</p><p>Mr Ku said he thought that if Congress were to invite Ms Tsai to address a joint session, it would be “something they would work up to.”</p><p>“Congress is eager to do things to help Taiwan,” he said, “so nothing, not even a Tsai address to Congress, can be ruled out in the current environment.”</p><p>The New York Times</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taiwan-elections-tsai-ing-wen-election-defeat-steps-down-democratic-progressive-party-china-a8650571.html','INDEPEDENT',NULL,'Taiwan\'s president Tsai Ing-wen steps down as chair of Democratic Progressive Party following local election losses','Premier vows to press on after defeat\n',NULL,'Staff and agencies','2018-11-25T01:36:49+00:00',1543109809000,'<p>Taiwan‘s president, Tsai Ing-wen, has resigned as chairwoman of the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after it suffered a major electoral defeat on Saturday, losing two of the island’s most important city posts in mayoral elections.</p><p>The results of the polls, being held just over a year before Taiwan’s next presidential election, are likely to please China, which claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has ramped up pressure on Tsai and her administration since she took office in 2016.</p><p>In the run-up to the elections, Ms Tsai and her government said repeatedly that China was trying to sway voters with “political bullying” and “fake news” — accusations that Beijing denied. </p><p>The DPP lost control of the mayoralties in Taiwan’s second-most populous city Taichung and the key battleground of Kaohsiung in the south, which it held for two decades and which played a central role in Taiwan’s pro-democracy movement in the 1970s.</p><p>Both were won by the China-friendly opposition, the Kuomintang, which once ruled China before fleeing to Taiwan at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949.</p><p>Ms Tsai said the DPP would reflect on the defeat, but she vowed to press on.</p><p>“Continuing reforms, freedom and democracy, and protecting the country’s sovereignty are the mission that the DPP won’t abandon,” she told reporters.</p><p>She said she would not accept the resignation of her premier William Lai, who had offered to quit earlier in the evening. </p><p>The DPP has now been left in control of only six of Taiwan’s cities and counties, compared with at least 15 for the Kuomintang.</p><p>The party held on in two of its other strongholds, however, keeping Tainan in the south and Taoyuan in the north.</p><p>“This is a tragic defeat for the DPP,” Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to the president, said.</p><p>“But this is not support for the Kuomintang from the people.

This time around, it is not just about China.</p><p>Reflecting 16 years of political changes and concomitant rising Taiwan identity, the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum opened its doors to the public in September as Taiwan’s new government looks to play down its connections to China while moving toward greater engagement with the rest of Asia.</p><p>Unlike its namesake in Taipei, where Chinese culture takes center stage, the museum, based in the southwestern county of Chiayi, celebrates the interconnectedness and cross-pollination of Asian cultures over the centuries. Current exhibits employ motifs including goods such as textiles, ceramics and tea, as well as references to Buddhism and Islam, to highlight the shared heritage of the world’s most populous continent.</p><p>An 18th-century green embroidered damask coat featuring Ottoman design, Chinese fabric and Russian lining hangs among Javanese sarongs and royal attire from South Asia. A statue of a Maitreya Buddha from Pakistan stands adjacent to a bronze Buddha head from 17th-century Burma. Twelfth-century ceramic arhats from Korea’s Goryeo kingdom look quizzically across a hall at Edo-era tea ware from Japan.</p><p>“It’s a global view of Asia,” said Wang Shih-Sheng, the museum’s chief curator. “Most of our artifacts come from our collection in Taipei, but when planning the project, we decided to look at things from an Asian perspective.”</p><p>The Taipei museum opened in 1965 and was used by Taiwan’s Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek as a source of local legitimacy vis-à-vis Mao’s Communists, the victors of the Chinese civil war. The museum was also employed as a tool for imposing a Chinese identity upon Taiwan residents.</p><p>Along with the Nationalists came more than 600,000 artifacts from the Palace Museum in Beijing, which was founded in 1925, the year after China’s last emperor, Puyi, who had not held the title of emperor since a short-lived restoration to the throne in 1917, was evicted from the Forbidden City. Before his expulsion, it became apparent that he and his court were selling off national treasures to survive.</p><p>Most of the items that survived the difficult voyage to Taiwan were produced by Chinese kingdoms and dynasties or nearby kingdoms, such as Tibet, who paid tribute to and traded with their Chinese neighbors.</p><p>Other items, however, came from further afield. Of little political use to the Nationalists, they took on a new significance after the election of Chen Shui- bian to the presidency of the Republic of China, as Taiwan has been called since 1945.</p><p>Mr. Chen was a member of the Democratic Progress Party, which sits at the center of the “pan-green” political camp in Taiwan’s politics that emphasizes Taiwan’s unique identity and prefers to keep the country self-determined. The party’s rise in the 2000 elections added a new voice to Taiwan’s identity politics in Taipei’s halls of power. By 2003, the idea of a new and very different branch of the National Palace Museum gained traction among pan-greens.</p><p>The man assigned to coordinate across ministries to establish the museum was Lin Sheng-Fong, who was Minister of State at the time and is now an associate professor of architecture at Shih Chien University in Taipei.</p><p>“There was a common belief that the Taipei Palace Museum had a huge collection and only a fraction of it was displayed,” Mr Lin said. “So we could create a second palace museum using the underdisplayed collection.”</p><p>Politicians in the sinocentric “pan-blue” camp that primarily includes the Nationalists were less enthusiastic, as were bureaucrats in the Taipei museum, Mr. Lin said. Deliberations concluded with Chiayi as the museum’s site and “Formosa in the great era of navigation” as its theme, he said.</p><p>A dispute with the initial architect, Antoine Predock, resulted in the stalling of the project. It restarted in 2010 with the involvement of the Taipei architect Kris Yao, who inherited a half-started project that presented several constraints, including an already-constructed shoreline on an artificial lake. Mr. Yao created a new design for the museum inspired by three primary strokes in Chinese calligraphy: one thick, one dry and one watery and smeared.</p><p>“It’s an abstraction of a very basic Chinese art translated into architecture,” Mr. Yao said.</p><p>The portion of the building representing the thick stroke contains the museum’s archive and exhibition area, which require minimal natural light to protect its contents. The dry stroke lets natural light in, and comprises the building’s exoskeleton, lobby and offices. The smeared stroke, embodying penetration, is composed of walking areas and the bridge that leads over the lake.</p><p>Inspired by his love of ancient Chinese bronzes, especially those of the Shang dynasty, Mr. Yao said he had digitized ancient dragon and cloud patterns for the scaly surface of the “thick stroke” portion of the building.</p><p>“It’s not a building, per se, it’s a form,” Mr. Yao said. “It sits on a totally green plain and is black and white.”</p><p>The museum’s prominence on Chiayi’s verdant coastal plain is a striking departure from the Taipei museum, a Chinese-style palace built into the side of a mountain. In his recent book “The Miraculous History of China’s Two Palace Museums,” the journalist Mark O’Neill wrote of Chiang’s demands for the National Palace Museum:</p><p>“The government wanted not only a traditional Chinese design that matched the art pieces inside but also a museum with the most modern conservation systems; it had to protect the pieces from earthquakes, typhoons, humidity, insects and air raids.”</p><p>A visit to the Taipei museum may leave visitors feeling adrift in the vast breadth of China’s geography and history. The Chiayi museum’s handful of exhibition rooms shrink both time and space, using Asia’s historical commercial and cultural exchanges, themselves often inseparable, to weave a regional patchwork that is neither exhaustive, nor exhausting. China’s important influence is not ignored, nor is it central to the museum.</p><p>Using the example of tea — a beverage that spread across ancient Asian trading routes — Ms. Wang expounded upon the shared differences of the museum’s exhibits.</p><p>“You can trace tea culture back to the Tang dynasty,” she said. “After arriving in other parts of Asia, it evolved because of local habits or culture,” with Tibetans adding yak butter or the Japanese grinding it to make matcha.</p><p>With the aim of creating the world’s top pan-Asian museum, Ms. Wang said the National Palace Museum would bring exhibitions in from other Asian collections around the world.</p><p>The ceramics hall, for example, currently displays Imari porcelain wares on loan from the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka. Future exhibitions will bring Japanese national treasures from the Tokyo National Museum and Kyushu National Museum, as well as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, she said.</p><p>Teresa Chiang, a Chiayi native visiting the museum with her parents and four-year-old daughter, said her first visit had left her feeling more connected to other Asian cultures. “At the Taipei museum you can’t enjoy Korean or Japanese culture,” she said. “Here you can see artifacts from all over Asia — I think it’s amazing.”</p>',NULL,NULL),(3,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/business/international/taiwan-semiconductor-china-factory-chips.html','NY Times','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/08/world/08Semiconductor-web/08Semiconductor-web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale',NULL,'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to Open Own Plant in China',NULL,NULL,' Paul Mozur','2015-12-07',1449446400000,'<p>As many of its competitors in the chip industry form partnerships in China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said on Monday that it was taking a different route: setting up a new manufacturing plant without help from a local partner.</p><p>The move is designed to protect its technology while playing to a China market brimming with makers of inexpensive smartphones. It is charting a course between keeping complex chip production facilities outside China and licensing technology to Chinese partners.</p><p>In an announcement Monday, Taiwan Semiconductor said it had submitted an application to Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs to invest in an advanced chip production facility in Nanjing, China. The total value of the investment is expected to be about $3 billion, though a spokesman for the company said it expected to save money by using equipment from facilities in Taiwan and capitalizing on Chinese subsidies.</p><p>In a nod to concerns about advanced chip protection technology being leaked to Chinese competitors, Taiwan Semiconductor said in a separate statement that by the time the facility in China is up and running, an advanced operation in Taiwan would be churning out chips a generation more sophisticated.</p><p>The company added that it “comprehensively protects its proprietary information” and, in referring to its fabrication plant, emphasized that it would “have whole ownership of the fab in China, which will help protect our intellectual property rights.”</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor’s approach stands in contrast to some of its rivals and partners in chip making. With the Chinese government set to spend tens of billions of dollars to build its chip industry, many foreign companies have been setting up partnerships and licensing technology in China.</p><p>During the past year, Qualcomm has partnered with the Chinese chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International to develop advanced chip production; Intel has invested in a subsidiary of China’s new national chip champion, Tsinghua Unigroup; and IBM has licensed some of its chip technology to a smaller Chinese partner.</p><p>As new links have grown, so, too, have concerns. In the United States, politicians and defense analysts say they are worried about Chinese theft of technology or advantages gained by close cooperation in the semiconductor industry. Advanced chip technology powers supercomputers that are used to manage defense systems, research new weapons and model things like nuclear detonations.</p><p>With an economy still based heavily on the chip supply chain, Taiwan’s government has also been particularly careful about allowing its most advanced semiconductor firms, like Taiwan Semiconductor, to cooperate closely with China.</p><p>Still, the recent spending spree by the Chinese government and chip companies has made a major impression on the island, and people in the industry in Taiwan acknowledge that the Chinese market is critical. For example, in its statement Taiwan Semiconductor said more than 50 percent of its revenue over the past five years had come from Chinese customers.</p>',NULL,NULL),(4,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/arts/international/cloud-gate-dance-theater-a-roving-bounding-symbol-of-taiwan.html','NY Times','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/15/arts/15CLOUDGATE-FLOATER/15CLOUDGATE-FLOATER-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale',NULL,'Cloud Gate Dance Theater: A Roving, Bounding Symbol of Taiwan',NULL,NULL,' Amy Qin','2015-09-11',1441929600000,'<p>NEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan — Most people in Taiwan are probably aware of the island’s pre-eminent performance group, Cloud Gate Dance Theater, even if they have no interest in modern dance.</p><p>Board a bus or a subway here, and you may see images of the troupe’s dancers emblazoned on the sides. Visit the popular Tamsui district and you may catch a glimpse of the company’s gleaming new $22 million home, which opened in April. If you travel on China Airlines, Taiwan’s flagship carrier, you may even fly on the Cloud Gate Liveried Aircraft, adorned with dancers’ likenesses. The airline unveiled it last year, saying the troupe represented the “pinnacle of Taiwan culture.”</p><p>Founded in 1973, Cloud Gate was Taiwan’s first professional dance company. Forty-two years later, it has become a roving, bounding symbol of this island. On Wednesday, it will open the annual Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the United States premiere of a 2013 work, “Rice.” The visit, with performances through Saturday, will be its sixth to the academy, and its first stop on a tour that will include performances in Los Angeles (January) and Washington (February). The company moves on to Paris in the spring.</p><p>Promoting Taiwan’s image abroad is a responsibility that Cloud Gate’s founder, artistic director and chief choreographer, Lin Hwai-Min, 68, does not take lightly.</p><p>“He’s a very public figure,” said Yatin Lin (no relation), a professor of dance studies at Taipei National University of the Arts. “Because of the political situation with mainland China, it’s very difficult for our political leaders to be active abroad, so many people see him as not just an artist but as a kind of cultural ambassador for Taiwan.”</p><p>This month, that commitment was on display as the choreographer marched into the rehearsal theater at the company’s new complex, clad in his signature uniform (black T-shirt, black pants) and brandishing a black backpack and a pack of cigarettes. While he settled at a table facing the stage, the company’s 22 dancers readied themselves for their first full run-through of “Rice” in a month.</p><p>As the music — a compilation of Hakka folk songs, drumming and Western classical music — began, a lone dancer strode out holding a long, quivering rattan stick. In the next 70 minutes, the dancers stamped, leapt and folded and unfolded their bodies in a demonstration of Cloud Gate’s hybrid aesthetic, which combines Western classical dance techniques with Eastern “rounded” movements that draw on martial arts and tai chi. Missing from the run-through was the production’s backdrop, a sumptuous video filmed on location over a cycle of rice cultivation in Chihshang in southeastern Taiwan.</p><p>Mr. Lin sat mostly silent, scribbling notes and only intermittently shouting (“Don’t rush, don’t rush!” and “Breathe!”). After the dancers took their final, choreographed bows, he stood and went through his notes, working with individuals on minor tweaks. The rehearsal had gone well and now the dancers just needed to focus on taking care of their bodies for the coming season, he told them later as they sat around him on the stage, stretching and massaging their muscles with foam rollers.</p><p>Later, in the company’s offices, Mr. Lin talked about the obligations he felt toward the dancers and society.</p><p>“I often remind the dancers that when they are onstage, they are often the only Taiwanese people that a lot of people get to see that are actually labeled as Taiwanese,” he said.</p><p>Much has changed since Mr. Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947. Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang’s National Revolutionary Army fled here in 1949 after losing the civil war to Mao’s Chinese Communists. The Kuomintang ruled Taiwan with an authoritarian hand for decades until 1996, when Taiwanese voters elected their president for the first time. Taiwan has been considered a democracy ever since (and may elect its first female president in January), but the island remains a disputed territory.</p><p>Growing up as the oldest of five children, Mr. Lin nurtured multiple passions, for politics, writing and dance. Only years later, while a student at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, did he decide to pursue choreography. He had spent two summers in New York studying dance at the Martha Graham School, and after completing his degree at Iowa he returned to Taiwan, and soon started Cloud Gate.</p><p>The company’s birth came just two years after what Mr. Lin, like many other Taiwanese, sees as a defining moment in the nation’s recent political history: the 1971 resolution that displaced the government in Taipei as the representative of China at the United Nations in favor of the government in Beijing.</p><p>“When I started the company I said, ‘Composed by Chinese, choreographed by Chinese, danced by Chinese, for a Chinese audience,’ ” said Mr. Lin, whose family has lived in Taiwan for generations. “Then Taiwan was kicked out of the U.N. and all of a sudden I had to figure out who I was.”</p><p>The event inspired “Legacy” (1978), which portrayed the early history of Taiwan. It was followed by such works as “Songs of the Wanderers,” “Moon Water” and the “Cursive” trilogy.</p><p>Reviews of Cloud Gate’s performances in the United States have been mixed. Critics have lauded the company\'s East-meets-West approach, with Anna Kisselgoff writing in The New York Times in 2003 that “Moon Water” was a “work unlike any other.” But Alastair Macaulay of The Times wrote in 2011 that the works were “repetitive” and called “Water Stains on the Wall” “devoid of lightness and humor.”</p><p>As the company’s stature grew, so too did the modern dance scene in Taiwan.</p><p>“Before Cloud Gate, there wasn’t even such thing as a wuzhe,” said Ping Heng, 57, the founder and artistic director of Dance Forum Taipei, using the term for dancer. “Before, people thought dancing was something you could do in school, but it wasn’t something worthy of being a profession. They just called dancers ‘tiaowu de ren,’ ” literally, people who dance.</p><p>Lin Lee-Chen, 65, the founder and artistic director of the Legend Lin Dance Theater in Taipei, said, “The dance scene in Taiwan today is very diverse,” with dance companies “of all sizes and styles.”</p><p>When asked about his possible retirement, Mr. Lin of Cloud Gate was reluctant to comment. But he acknowledged that the company’s new complex, which he said would allow his troupe and other dance and theatrical ventures to perpetuate the “Cloud Gate energy,” would make it easier for him to step away.</p><p>Still, “I don’t want any statues,” he said. “I’m a Buddhist. I think everything is just illusory, especially for dancers.</p><p>“We know that dance happens, but it also vanishes when it happens,” he said. “All we are creating is air. We are giving society a different air, that’s all.”</p>',NULL,NULL),(5,'https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/world/asia/05taiwan.html','NY Times',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6,'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/asia/xi-jinping-taiwan-china.html','NY Times','undefined',NULL,'Xi Jinping Warns Taiwan That Unification Is the Goal and Force Is an Option',NULL,NULL,' Chris Buckley and Chris Horton','2019-01-01',1546300800000,'<p>BEIJING — China’s president, Xi Jinping, warned Taiwan that unification must be the ultimate goal of any talks over its future and that efforts to assert full independence could be met by armed force, laying out an unyielding position on Wednesday in his first major speech about the contested island democracy.</p><p>Mr. Xi outlined his stance one day after Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, urged China to peacefully settle disputes over the island, whose 23 million people, she said, want to preserve their self-rule. But Beijing treats Taiwan as an illegitimate breakaway from Chinese rule, and Mr. Xi said unification was unstoppable as China rose.</p><p>“The country is growing strong, the nation is rejuvenating and unification between the two sides of the strait is the great trend of history,” Mr. Xi told officials, military officers and guests in the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing.</p><p>China would respect the Taiwanese people’s religious and legal freedoms in a unified “one country, two systems” framework, Mr. Xi said. But he warned that the profound political differences between Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, and China, a highly authoritarian government, were no excuse to reject unification.</p><p>“Different systems are not an obstacle to unification, and even less are they an excuse for separatism,” Mr. Xi said. “The private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwanese compatriots will be fully assured.”</p><p>Mr. Xi also accompanied his offer of talks with a warning — one implicitly also aimed at the United States, which provides Taiwan with military equipment and the possibility of support in a crisis.</p><p>“We make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures,” Mr. Xi said in a section of the speech that drew rousing applause. Those options, he said, could be used against “intervention by external forces.”</p><p>The diverging positions staked out by Mr. Xi and Ms. Tsai have brought into focus how the disputed future of Taiwan remains a volatile question that could erupt into crisis, especially if either side misjudges the intentions of the other — or of the United States, a key ally that has strengthened support for Taiwan.</p><p>Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which handles relations with China, said it did not have an immediate comment on Mr. Xi’s speech.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s offer of dialogue appeared unlikely to win over Taiwanese wary of the idea that they could retain autonomy under China’s principle of “one country, two systems,” Yun Sun, a researcher on Chinese policy at the Stimson Center in Washington, said by email after the speech.</p><p>“Xi is correct in that differences in political systems are the root of the problem,” Ms. Sun said. “But ‘one country, two systems’ is unlikely to be the answer the Taiwanese people embrace.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech was a sharp reminder that, even amid many other external disputes, Chinese leaders remain preoccupied with Taiwan, especially their concern that the island could defy their demands and embrace formal independence.</p><p>China is Taiwan’s biggest trade partner, taking over 30 percent of its exports. Many Taiwanese, though, bridle at Beijing using its growing influence to isolate them from international participation, and to press them toward eventually accepting Chinese sovereignty over the island.</p><p>Since coming to power in late 2012, Mr. Xi has warned Taiwan against any shift toward independence and repeatedly met with Taiwanese politicians from the Kuomintang, the party that ruled China before the Communist Party and that now favors closer ties with Beijing. But Mr. Xi’s address was his first major speech as president devoted to Taiwan, said Bonnie S. Glaser, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>“My initial impression is that the speech is a reaffirmation of current policy,” Ms. Glaser said. She also noted that despite Mr. Xi’s renewed call for unification, he did not set a deadline. “It is notable that there is no mention of a timetable or deadline for reunification — it is just a goal,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Xi indicated that China’s multipronged pressure on Taiwan is likely to persist after Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which is wary of moving closer to China, suffered stinging setbacks in local Taiwanese elections in November. The opposition Kuomintang won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities, prompting Ms. Tsai to resign as leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, though she remains Taiwan’s president.</p><p>Chinese state-run media have depicted the election reversals as a vindication of Mr. Xi’s approach to Taiwan: a battery of measures to isolate Taiwan and undercut its international standing since Ms. Tsai won the presidency in 2016.</p><p>Taiwan’s status has been contested by Communist leaders since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated in the revolution retreated to the island. Tensions have resurged since the 1990s, when Taiwan became a democracy and many voters on the island turned to politicians who argue that Taiwan should keep China at a distance, or even assert outright independence.</p><p>Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party has been at the forefront of those independence-leaning views, and after she won power, China quickly cut high-level contacts, arguing that Ms. Tsai had failed to acknowledge that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.</p><p>In the past three years, China has accelerated efforts to peel away countries from the list of those that give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Last spring, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso established ties with China, and in August, El Salvador cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan, leaving 17 nations that maintain their diplomatic allegiance with the island.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech commemorated the 40 years since China laid out a new approach to Taiwan soon after the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing at the start of 1979. But the United States has remained Taiwan’s most important partner, and the Trump administration has bolstered some support, to the consternation of Chinese officials.</p><p>In March, President Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages official government exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. And in June, the United States dedicated a new $250 million unofficial embassy in Taipei.</p><p>On the last day of 2018, Mr. Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which tries to counter China’s growing military influence. The section of the law on Taiwan reiterates American commitment “to counter efforts to change the status quo and to support peaceful resolution acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” It also calls on the American president to send high-level officials to Taiwan and to regularly sell arms to the island.</p><p>The United States and China have brushed close to military conflict over Taiwan: in the 1950s and in 1996, when President Bill Clinton dispatched two carrier groups to seas off Taiwan after China fired intimidating missiles ahead of a Taiwanese presidential election.</p><p>The United States dispatched warships to the Taiwan Strait three times last year to show support for Taiwan. That was done under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation last month has left some question about the Americans’ involvement going forward.</p><p>In his speech, Mr. Xi “appears to implicitly make an argument that use of force should be a last resort,” Ms. Glaser said. “Of course, Xi has to leave that option on the table, but he makes clear it is not his preference.”</p>',NULL,NULL),(7,'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/world/asia/xhina-xi-jinping-taiwan.html','NY Times','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/world/03china-taiwan-1-print/merlin_148671144_2ec719ff-6236-43ec-977c-7abf08efcfd3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale',NULL,'Unification Plan From China Finds Few Takers in Taiwan',NULL,NULL,' Chris Buckley and Chris Horton','2019-01-02',1546387200000,'<p>BEIJING — President Xi Jinping declared on Wednesday that he wants progress on China’s decades-long quest to win control of Taiwan.

And as an ardent patriot, Mr. Xi finds Taiwan’s separate status especially galling.</p><p>Mr. Xi did not lay down a timetable for absorbing Taiwan, which is something more hawkish voices in Beijing have urged. But as he nears his seventh year as president, he indicated that his patience had limits and that he wanted to bring Taiwan into ever-closer political, economic and cultural orbit around China.</p><p>“That the two sides of the strait are still not fully unified is a wound to the Chinese nation left by history,” Mr. Xi said in his direction-setting speech in the Great Hall of the People. The political divisions between China and Taiwan, he added “cannot be passed on from generation to generation.”</p><p>But even laced with this sense of urgency, Mr. Xi’s recipe for bringing Taiwan closer to absorption into “one China” appeared unlikely to win over many on the island, even after its president, Tsai Ing-wen — openly loathed by Beijing — suffered bruising electoral losses in November.</p><p>On the one hand, Mr. Xi threatened military force if Taiwanese leaders grasped for independence. On the other hand, Mr. Xi said that if Taiwan were to agree to unification, its rights would be ensured by the “one country, two systems” framework that Beijing used in Hong Kong after it returned from British colonial control in 1997.</p><p>But neither the threat nor the promised reward seemed likely to sharply weaken Taiwanese opposition to China’s demands, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University who studies relations between China and Taiwan.</p><p>“Xi Jinping’s approach is to use a bigger stick and to make the carrot sweeter,” he said in a telephone interview. But having seen Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms squeezed by Beijing in recent years, many Taiwanese people were likely to be suspicious of Mr. Xi’s offers, he said.</p><p>Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed legal autonomy since it returned to Chinese sovereignty, and residents of the city still have much wider freedoms than citizens in the rest of China. But publishing, news media and pro-democratic activism in Hong Kong have retreated in recent years, reflecting the growing weight of Chinese political pressures.</p><p>Virtually no section of the electorate in Taiwan would find “one country, two systems” an attractive goal, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain who studies the island’s politics. “Taiwan is not a colony à la Hong Kong, and it has everything to lose and nothing to gain from agreeing to it,” Professor Sullivan said.</p><p>Even so, Mr. Xi had political motives to show that he was working to absorb Taiwan, Professor Sullivan said. “Having unification as a national aspiration is incredibly useful for the Chinese Communist Party, which stakes its legitimacy on economic growth and nationalism,” he said. “The former is becoming more difficult to deliver, and so the latter becomes more important.”</p><p>Few experts believe that Mr. Xi’s speech augured an eruption of conflict over Taiwan. But tensions could rise, especially as his speech jarred so much with comments from Ms. Tsai.</p><p>Taiwan and China have been at loggerheads, sometimes close to full-scale war, since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated by Mao Zedong’s revolutionary armies retreated to the island. But Beijing’s fears that Taiwan could embrace full independence have grown only since the 1990s, when the island moved to democratic elections that brought to life parties that rejected Chinese identity.</p><p>“Tsai and Xi are sticking to their positions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is little reason to expect any improvement in cross-strait ties as a result of these major statements. But there is also little reason to expect a crisis.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s speech marked 40 years since China set out a new approach to unification with Taiwan soon after the United States shifted diplomatic ties from the Republic of China — the name for the government on the island — to the communist government in Beijing.</p><p>But in a speech on Monday, Ms. Tsai said Taiwan’s 23 million people wanted to maintain their self-rule, and she warned against reading the recent setbacks of her Democratic Progressive Party as a rejection of that principle. In November, the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities.</p><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Tsai promptly rejected “one country, two systems” as a basis for negotiations.</p><p>“Here I must reiterate that Taiwan will never accept ‘one country, two systems,’ ” she told reporters in Taipei, the capital of the island, in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “Democracy is a value and lifestyle cherished by the Taiwanese people.”</p><p>The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected Mr. Xi’s proposal. It said in an emailed comment that the Chinese government had already “gravely wrecked Hong Kong, that window into ‘one country, two systems.’ ”</p><p>Mr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification.</p><p>But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China’s political goals.</p><p>“Compatriots on both sides of the strait are a family,” he said. “With the one-China principle as a bedrock, there are no obstacles to any political party or group on Taiwan interacting with us.”</p><p>The Chinese government was willing to open discussions with politicians and representatives from Taiwan, so long as they opposed independence for the island and accepted Beijing’s formula for “one China,” Mr. Xi said. He also held out greater access to China’s vast and growing economy. China already accounts for over 30 percent of Taiwan’s trade, and the promised links could appeal to some Taiwanese cities looking to speed growth.</p><p>Jason Hsu, a Taiwanese legislator who belongs to the Kuomintang, said Taiwanese voters were not likely to be directly influenced by Chinese overtures but were concerned about economic prosperity.</p><p>“Most Taiwanese voters are in the middle,” he said. “They care more about prosperity and managing the cross-strait relationship.”</p><p>Analysts saw parallels between Mr. Xi’s proposals and the “united front” tactics that the Chinese Communist Party has evolved to divide, tame and co-opt potential opponents in China, Hong Kong and increasingly abroad.</p><p>“Behind the speech there is a clear intention, which is to intensify the united front work, to multiply the connections and bonds of dependence upon mainland China,” said Professor Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. “For someone who lives in Hong Kong, there are a lot of echoes of what’s happened here.”</p><p>Still, Taiwan’s diverse electorate, economy and politics made it much more difficult for China’s divide-and-control approach to succeed there, he said. Ms. Tsai said she would oppose any Chinese efforts to shape Taiwan’s decisions by recruiting support from local politicians and groups.</p><p>“There must not be meddling in the Taiwanese people’s elections through creating divisions and lures,” Ms. Tsai said in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “It must be the government, or a public authority authorized by the government, that sits down for any talks.”</p>',NULL,NULL),(8,'https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/world/asia/11taiwan.html','NY Times',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9,'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/world/asia/13taiwan.html','NY Times',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10,'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/opinion/taiwans-president-caves-in-to-china.html','NY Times','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/07/opinion/07kaixi/07kaixi-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale',NULL,'Taiwan’s President Caves In to China',NULL,NULL,' Wu’er Kaixi','2015-11-06',1446768000000,'<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The “historic” meeting that is to take place in Singapore on Saturday between the leaders of China and Taiwan is nothing to cheer about. There will be no progress in terms of peace and reconciliation. The world will witness nothing but politics at its most cynical.</p><p>This is to be expected of the president of China, Xi Jinping, who has put the world into a swoon with his economic diplomacy while persecuting dissent and freedom of speech at home, systematically arresting human-rights lawyers and parading a Stalinesque purge of his political enemies as a crackdown on corruption. In this sense, he might even be excused for pretending to make history. It is simply his job, and he is answerable to no one.</p><p>Taiwan’s elected president, Ma Ying-jeou, on the other hand, cannot be excused. Unlike Mr. Xi, he is accountable to the people of Taiwan who elected him.</p><p>Relations between China and Taiwan have been tense since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek lost a civil war to Mao Zedong’s Communist forces and retreated to the island with his troops. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province, while Taiwanese views of the mainland have evolved over the decades. Mr. Ma was elected in 2008 after a campaign calling for more trade and warmer relations with the mainland, but the sense now is that he’s gone too far.</p><p>In the run-up to the 2012 elections that ushered him into his second and last term as president, Mr. Ma said there was “no way” he would meet with the leadership of China. The Taiwanese are rightfully anxious about the economic and military rise of China and have given up on finding any common ground for discussion with China on Beijing’s primary — in fact, only — goal: reunification.</p><p>Why then, just two months ahead of presidential and legislative elections, would Mr. Ma backtrack and agree to dine with the one man who presents the greatest threat to Taiwan’s democratic and open society?</p><p>The answer is simple. Mr. Ma knows that his party, the Kuomintang, or KMT, is very likely to not only lose the presidency on Jan. 16, but also, in a historical first, lose control of Parliament, putting power in the hands of politicians better attuned to voters’ anti-reunification sentiments. Both Mr. Ma and his counterpart in China are desperate to make a last-minute deal that would give the KMT a fighting chance to retain its grip on Taiwan’s legislature.</p><p>It is not wild speculation to conclude that the only circumstances under which the meeting between Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi could possibly have come about is one in which Mr. Xi offers a concession to Taiwan’s departing president in the hope that it leads to continued KMT control of Taiwan.</p><p>If Mr. Ma and Mr. Xi were particularly smart — and recent history provides no guarantee of that — they may have agreed that Mr. Xi will make a grand gesture, such as an offer to withdraw the missiles that currently threaten Taiwan, in return for a continuation of the status quo with movement toward closer relations. The logic would be that a grand gesture like this would resonate with a nervous Taiwan electorate and could even reshape the electoral landscape.</p><p>Alternatively, Mr. Xi might offer Taiwan even closer economic ties and a role in China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which so far has been denied Taiwan. But this would fail and only push the Taiwanese electorate further into the camp of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which holds a strong lead in polls.</p><p>The Taiwanese have increasingly come to see closer economic ties with China as a threat to their political and cultural autonomy. In fact, it has been Mr. Ma’s attempts at economic rapprochement with China that have largely led to disaffection with not only the KMT but the entire political process in Taiwan. This has been a significant factor in the rise of independent parties, student protests and increased identity politics.</p><p>But let us imagine that the two leaders make the smartest of possible moves, and Mr. Xi offers Taiwan a concession — such as removal of the missiles just across the narrow Taiwan Strait — that wins the KMT some of those elusive parliamentary seats.</p><p>It would be a victory for Mr. Xi and for Mr. Ma — particularly if the KMT were able to hold on to Parliament. The presidential duo could package it to the international community as a major stride toward peace and reconciliation. Western columnists would rub their hands in glee and write in adulatory terms of China and Taiwan’s push for peace in a strife-riddled world.</p><p>Nevertheless, the truth will remain that whatever happens on Saturday in Singapore is nothing more than cynical politics — cynical politics that come at a huge cost for Taiwan. The reason: for the first time since the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1949, one of its leaders will have become a broker in Taiwan’s electoral process.</p><p>This is not something that China’s leadership has earned. It is a position the Chinese have bullied their way into. Meanwhile, Mr. Ma has betrayed his voters by joining forces with the greatest threat to their sovereignty — and purely for political gain.</p>',NULL,NULL);

In the eyes of Beijing, of course, Taiwan—despite its democratic elections and self-governing status—is part of China.</p><p>Earlier this month, however, the Trump administration gave its tacit approval (paywall) to Taiwan’s request to purchase 60 F-16V fighter jets. A formal request would still need US congressional approval, but the news has already rattled Beijing.</p><p>Addressing the issue on Thursday (March 28), defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said that China “resolutely opposes” such sales to Taiwan and that any words or actions that undermine the one-China policy are “extremely dangerous.”</p><p>On the same day, foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a briefing:</p><p>Before answering the question, he took issue with how a reporter described Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen. “First I need to correct you on the title of Tsai Ing-wen. She is the leader of the Taiwan Region. The so-called title of ‘president’ is never recognized by China.”</p><p>The jets, in reality, wouldn’t do much to change the power equation across the Taiwan Strait, “nor will it eliminate the threat that China poses to forcibly absorb a democratic Taiwan,” Scott Harold, an associate director of Rand Corp.’s Center for Asia Pacific Policy, told Bloomberg (paywall).</p><p>The F-16Vs are advanced for what they are—fourth-generation fighter jets—but China has fifth-generation stealth fighters, such as the J-20, that are deemed rivals to Lockheed Martin’s advanced F-22s and F-35s. Sales of F-35s to Taiwan, which have been ruled out, would be far more of a provocation to China.</p><p>Instead, the sale of the F-16s would be more of a political shock to Beijing. The last time the US sold fighter jets to Taiwan—150 F-16s under the administration of president George H. W. Bush—China suspended military exchanges with the US. How it would respond this time is uncertain, though it’s hard to imagine China starting a conflict over the sale of a few dozen not-so-cutting-edge jets.</p><p>What’s clear, however, is that tension in the Taiwan Strait is increasing. In recent years China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan, including ones involving bombers and fighter jets last year. And earlier today (March 31), Chinese jets crossed a maritime border, a move Taiwan’s defense ministry said “seriously impacted regional safety and stability.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(2,'https://qz.com/1580642/google-honors-tragic-adventurous-life-of-taiwanese-female-writer-san-mao/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Google honors the tragic life of an adventurous Taiwanese female writer','null',NULL,'Echo Huang','2019-03-26T10:53:15.000Z',1553597595000,'<p>Today’s Google Doodle celebrates the 76th birthday of San Mao, the Taiwanese writer who inspired generations of Chinese women with her poetic writing and adventurous life abroad.</p><p>San Mao, the pen name of Chen Mao Ping, was born in 1943—one of the most chaotic periods of contemporary China—and moved to Taiwan with her family at the age of five from southwestern Chongqing, then the capital city of the Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist party, before its retreat to Taiwan following its civil war defeat to Communist Party forces. (San Mao changed her birth name to Chen Ping in 1946.)</p><p>She began her travels abroad in her 20s and spent most of her life in places distant from her homeland, eventually visiting 59 countries. Over her life, she published 20 books (link in Chinese) based on her experiences traveling across Europe and Africa, from the 1970s to her death by suicide in 1991. Through this writing, San Mao depicted a life unimaginable for most of her readers, and inspired them to look on life with a different perspective.</p><p>The doodle depicts her as a long-haired woman holding a pen and paper sitting in a desert, perfectly capturing one of the most important times of San Mao’s life in the Spanish Sahara, at the time a colonial area where administrators from Spain lived in uneasy coexistence with nomadic Sahrawi Arabs.</p><p>San Mao wrote about the conflicts and the struggles for Sahrawi’s liberation from colonialism as well as her marriage with José María Quero, a Spanish man she lived with in the Sahara until he died in a diving accident in 1979. She began publishing those stories in 1974 in a major Taiwanese newspaper, and they’ve been translated into different languages, including Dutch, Spanish and Catalan.</p><p>“Her vivid prose, independent spirit, and willingness to travel widely in a search for knowledge inspired many of her readers to retrace her steps,” said Google’s doodle notes.</p><p>She eventually returned to Taiwan.

Most other democracies around the world don’t recognize Taiwan as an independent country, in deference to China, and it is barred from the United Nations. While the United States has recently partnered with Taiwan officials to fight intellectual property theft, this January Chinese president Xi Jinping warned that Beijing could retake the island by force.</p><p>The Kashmir region between India and Pakistan has been disputed for more than 70 years, a legacy of the Partition that accompanied Britain’s withdrawal from India in 1947. Tensions rose in the volatile region in recent weeks, after India conducted a “pre-emptive strike” in Pakistan-controlled territory, and Pakistan captured an Indian fighter pilot. The mostly Muslim residents of the India-administered Kashmir Valley view the national government as an occupying force, and Pakistan officials support their self-government.</p><p>Russia’s neighbors may also be affected. Russia has already called out US “hypocrisy” over sanctions related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, notes Stacie Goddard, a professor of political science at Wellesley College. “In the short run, this is most likely to bolster Russia’s confidence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia,” the breakaway territories that were once part of Georgia, but now supported by Russian military. The deal could also make Russia “less likely to reduce its presence in  the Donbass region of Ukraine,” Goddard said.</p><p>So far there are no signs that the Trump administration is interested in inserting itself into the long-simmering Pakistan-India dispute. However, the US Navy has increased its presence in the Taiwan Strait, most recently on March 24, responding to Beijing’s circling of the island in recent drills. The US’s policy towards Ukraine remains in question under the Trump presidency.</p><p>Trump made the unprecedented Golan Heights decision in a bid to boost prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of national elections April 9. Netanyahu has been charged in several corruption cases, although he still maintains an edge in polls. He applauded as Trump signed the proclamation, while secretary of state Mike Pompeo and vice president Mike Pence looked on:</p><p>Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and the United Nations immediately condemned Trump’s proclamation, and the UN declared Israel’s annexation of the area “null and void.” As president, Trump has pulled the US out of international agreements, including the Paris Climate Accord and the TransPacific Partnership, but the Golan Heights decision is being specifically criticized as breaking international law.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'https://qz.com/1374487/taipeis-dragon-tower-provides-alternative-form-of-burial/','QUARTZ',NULL,'In land-scarce Taipei, the True Dragon Tower is a vertical home for the dead','null',NULL,'Isabella Steger','2019-03-13T13:30:23.000Z',1552483823000,'<p>Nestled in the mountains near the northern coastline of Taiwan, just outside of its capital, is a tower that, once full, will house the ashes of 400,000 people. </p><p>At 20 stories tall, the True Dragon Tower is the biggest columbarium in the world. It’s a striking manifestation of two problems plaguing countries all around Asia—a rapidly aging population, and a lack of space for the dead in urban centers. </p><p>That makes death big business in places like Taiwan, an island nation just slightly larger than the state of Maryland. True Dragon Tower is owned by Lung Yen Life Service, a Taiwan-listed company that is the third-largest funeral services operator in the world by market capitalization. After a decade of construction, the tower finally opened for business in 2002. Its soaring height was, in part, a response to the rapidly increasing rate of cremation in Taiwan. In the 1950s (pdf, link in Chinese), the Taiwanese government promoted it instead of ground burials in anticipation of a space crunch in the future, said the spokeswoman for Lung Yen. Well over 90% of people in Taiwan are now cremated, a rate similar to that of other developed places in Asia such as Japan and Hong Kong.</p><p>People over 65 currently account for more than 14% of Taiwan’s population of 23.6 million, fitting the World Health Organization’s definition of an aged society. According to government projections, Taiwan’s population will peak in 2021, and fall below 20 million in 2050. The country already has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and as Taiwan’s fertility rate continues to drop, by 2065, 41.2% of the population could be elderly. The challenges that come with a large elderly population, though, have already begun; the number of deaths in Taiwan averaged over 170,000 people per year in the last two years and is rising every year. Much of Taiwan is mountainous and unsuitable for development, so almost 7 million people are concentrated in Taipei proper and New Taipei City, the municipality surrounding the capital.</p><p>As the competition between the living and the dead intensifies in densely populated cities like Taipei, companies and governments are promoting alternative forms of burial, which the public largely accepts, though sometimes deeply-rooted beliefs about death mean that the public isn’t always quick to adopt them.</p><h2>Flashing Buddhas</h2><p>A space for the afterlife doesn’t come cheap in True Dragon Tower. After all, the building was designed as a “hotel for the dead,” as described by a company spokeswoman. </p><p>A basic individual niche measures about 22 by 25 centimeters (9 by 10 inches) and starts at about NT$200,000 ($6,500). More elaborate niches can cost more than NT$1 million at the top end (excluding the costs of other funereal procedures such as memorial services and burning offerings). For reference, the average monthly wage of a worker in Taiwan in 2018 was about NT$40,000. Sometimes people buy niches for themselves, but more often it’s the deceased’s family that raise the money to pay for the right spot. The fees for a niche reserve the space indefinitely, so families don’t have to worry about raising more to renew a lease of sorts.</p><p>On the outside, the tower is shaped like a white trapezoidal prism and is almost entirely opaque, with a pagoda at its apex. Each floor in the tower has a different theme depending on the customer’s religious belief and aesthetic preference. One floor offers features such as state-of-the-art LED mini Buddha statues (technology that’s been imported from Japan) embedded in each niche door. Others offer more neutral palettes, intended for Christians or atheists. Among the most striking levels is on the 17th floor, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Tadao Ando. It features a space bathed in white marble floors and stacked with porcelain niches to evoke the lightness of a heavenly afterlife. About 8% of True Dragon Tower’s niches are occupied already. </p><p>According to Chinese belief, the spirit lives on in the afterlife, so people want their loved ones to be buried somewhere pleasant. That’s why there’s a park surrounding the tower—it’s part of the hotel experience for the dead. The land—long owned by the family that runs Lung Yen—covers some 55 hectares (136 acres) and overlooks the Taiwan Strait. The park is designed to fulfill the basic feng shui principle that buildings are most auspiciously oriented (paywall) when they face water with mountains to the back. Graves and mausoleums dot the space, catering to Taiwan’s wealthiest individuals and families. There is also a columbarium for animals, reflecting the large amounts of money that Taiwanese are willing to allocate towards their pets as fewer people have children to spend it on.</p><p>Demand is only growing for Lung Yen’s facilities. In the next five to seven years, Ando will build another (more horizontal) columbarium next to True Dragon Tower, complete with gardens brimming with cherry blossom trees. The Japanese architect will also build three other such columbaria and park space around Taiwan.</p><h2>Eco-burials</h2><p>Lung Yen’s offerings are out of reach for the average Taiwanese citizen, many of whom will instead turn to public services, for which a citizen pays a minimal fee to be buried in a public facility. As columbaria become overcrowded—and NIMBYism prevents governments from freely building new facilities to store people’s ashes in dense urban areas—governments around Asia have vigorously promoted alternative forms of burial to tackle the problem of land scarcity.</p><p>Since the 2000s, the Taiwan government, along with some religious institutions, have been offering environmental “eco-burials.” Customers can opt to have a relative’s ashes scattered at sea, or buried in a mound of soil in a bed of flowers or around a tree. Wang Wen-hsiu, an official with Taipei’s mortuary services office, said that some 24,000 people die each year in the capital, and space is running out in Taipei’s three public columbaria. Currently, all ashes must be exhumed from their niches after 50 years unless somebody renews the lease. If no one does, then the government exhumes the ashes and eco-buries them. </p><p>Chinese traditions of ancestral worship and the firm belief that the dead should have an eternal place to rest make the scattering of ashes a hard proposition for most Taiwanese to accept. But it is catching on. In Taipei, about 22% of people chose eco-burials, particularly tree burials, in the first half of 2018 (sea burials are the least popular form of eco-burial in Taiwan). Non-traditional burials have had less success elsewhere, like in Hong Kong where, despite the government’s attempt (paywall) to popularize them, only 13% opted for eco-burials in 2017.</p><h2>Going mainstream</h2><p>There are a few reasons why eco-burials have been so successful in Taiwan. For one, they’re free. The Taipei government will even subsidize people who want to take their relatives’ ashes out of a public columbarium for a green burial, said Wang.</p><p>Another reason is demographics. Wang Chen-ling (no relation to the other Wang), an associate professor in land management at Feng Chia University in Taichung, said as Taiwan’s population ages and its birth rate plummets, people who don’t have dependents are more prone to choosing a hassle-free form of burial that doesn’t require relatives to tend to a grave or perform rites of ancestral worship. Religious groups also had a major effect on bringing the concept into the mainstream in Taiwan, said Wang, particularly after a revered Buddhist master, when he died in 2009, chose for his ashes to be scattered in a garden at the monastery he founded on the outskirts of Taipei. Today, there is even a waiting list (link in Chinese) for tree burials at the monastery.</p><p>But a more fundamental change in the way that Taiwanese think about death is underway. Wang, the city mortuary official, said that successful attempts to “park-ify” eco-burial grounds are also helping to make death less scary and taboo, and more a part of everyday life,and promote green burials in the process.</p><p>Taipei now has two public parks (link in Chinese) that double as graveyards where tree and flower burials take place. People are increasingly hanging out there—the government has even organized music concerts at tree-burial grounds—as a communal way of remembering the dead in place of performing traditional rites at graves or columbaria. In the future, going to one of these parks could be like “going to an art museum,” Wang said.</p><p>Lily Kong, a geographer, wrote in an academic journal (paywall) in 2011 that Taipei was one city that had successfully managed to change the perception of cemeteries in Chinese cultures of being “sites wrapped in unhealthy miasma.” </p><p>As people in land-strapped nations move away from cultural practices that take up too much space, they may find those places become more pleasant to live. Instead of seeking out solemn spaces dedicated to the dead, their descendants may attend a concert or take a walk in the park as a way to remember their ancestors.</p><p>Be sure to download the Quartz Brief app for iOS to explore our 3D model of Dragon Tower in augmented reality.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(5,'https://qz.com/india/1569959/tier-2-indias-splurging-on-luxury-boutiques-fashion-jewellery/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Small-town India is splurging on luxury—and here’s what it’s buying','null',NULL,'Aria Thaker','2019-03-11T06:56:27.000Z',1552287387000,'<p>India’s luxury market is getting a boost from the country’s tier II cities.</p><p>High end spending in these towns grew at a rate 30 times greater than in tier I cities between 2013 and 2018, according to an analysis by credit card company American Express. Overall luxury spending in India itself grew by 4% in this period, the data showed.</p><p>The firm analysed transaction-related data from around 600 luxury goods merchants across the country for the study.</p><p>This spike in the growth in luxury spending in tier II cities came amidst “some strict measures by the Indian government in 2016 such as demonetisation, increased excise duty on gold and diamond jewellery, and increased tax on other luxury goods to curb ‘black money,’” the American Express report reads. Many analysts believe the luxury market was hit hard by the 2016 rule that customers must submit their permanent account numbers (PAN) for transactions of over Rs2 lakh (around $3,000), according to a November 2018 report in the Economic Times newspaper.</p><p>India’s luxury market is expected to touch $30 billion in overall value in 2018-19, compared to $23.8 billion in 2017-18, according to a Kotak report. </p><h2>What they’re buying</h2><p>The types of luxury purchases being made have also changed dramatically since 2013. </p><p>“While jewellery spending dominated the category till 2013, we have seen other segments, including electronic and high-end fashion, grow in share and even surpass jewellery spends in certain markets,” said Manoj Adalakha, CEO of American Express India.</p><p>Tier I India also spends on luxury goods in very different ways than tier II India does. For example, luxury merchants in tier I cities—major metro areas like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad—recorded over twice as much spend per merchant on jewellery in 2018 (26%) as in 2013 (11%).</p><p>But in tier II cities like Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, and Meerut, jewellery spending stayed quite small at 4% of the total in 2018. </p><p>Tier II India was much more likely to spend at high-end fashion boutiques and shops.</p><h2>Crazy rich Asians</h2><p>American Express also studied travellers visiting India. While around 58% of the spending in this category came from people flying in from the US and UK, big spenders seem to be increasingly arriving from east Asian countries.</p><p>Travellers from Hong Kong were the third-largest luxury spenders in India in 2018.

It was the first time one of her friends had passed away, and she wasn’t sure how to feel. Wang had written a letter to Santa the year before, so she decided to sit down and write another. This time, she shared her feelings.</p><p>“I’m not going to devote this whole card to talking about Christmas and presents,” she wrote in English in an undated letter sent to St. Nick in Rovaniemi, Finland, which bills itself as the “official hometown of Santa Claus.” The town’s post office, which shared the letter, asked Quartz to not publish the full name of the writer to protect her privacy.</p><p>“Yesterday, I found out a girl in my dance class died. How did the girl feel when she learned she had cancer? I hope the girl is happy now. Sometimes, life doesn’t go the way you wish. But you have to stand up and control your own life. Because you’re the only one who has the ability to change it.”</p><p>Wang is among a fast-growing number of people from China who are writing to Santa. The Santa Claus Village’s main post office in the Arctic Circle receives some 500,000 letters annually from across the world, the majority of which are from Greater China, the office says, a region that also includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p><p>Last Christmas, Santa received a record 16,500 letters from mainland China, making up 15% of the approximately 110,000 letters from the region. In 2014, Greater China overtook the United Kingdom, Italy, and Poland for sending the most letters. Santa’s rising popularity, however, is a stark contrast to China’s ongoing war on Christmas.</p><h2>Banned Christmas</h2><p>Chinese enthusiasm for Christmas isn’t necessarily surprising considering the holiday’s commercial appeal, growing Chinese exposure to the West through media and study abroad, and recent efforts by Finland to attract Chinese visitors to Rovaniemi. But the phenomenon also coincides with an intensifying government crackdown on Christianity and Western influences more broadly from NGOs to international-style education.</p><p>Unlike in Hong Kong, Christmas is not an official holiday in mainland China, and has in fact increasingly been banned in various cities in recent years. On Dec. 15, security officials in Langfang, a city in Hebei province, issued a notice prohibiting the display of Christmas materials and spreading of “religious propaganda” in public areas including schools and plazas, according to ChinaAid, a US-based group that advocates for religious freedom. The notice also warned against selling Christmas products and instructed local workers to ensure a “healthy and orderly environment” during the Christmas period.</p><p>Last Christmas, some local governments, Communist Party organizations, and schools also restricted celebrations. One city even said it would fine individuals caught selling or making fake snow, the Financial Times reported (paywall). State-backed Chinese media last year denied a national Christmas crackdown and insisted local bans were for maintaining security. Critics, however, believe that the grounds of maintaining security are little more than a front to restrict what little religious freedoms remain in China.</p><p>This month, China’s Christian churches are witnessing an intensifying attack on their freedom to worship, starting with the detention of more than 100 worshippers attending an unofficial congregation held by the Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu, one of the few house churches that operates in the open. While many were subsequently released and placed under surveillance, the church’s prominent pastor and his wife remain in custody, having been arrested on allegations of “inciting subversion of state power.”</p><p>Chu Yanqing, an underground “family church” leader in Beijing, told Quartz that the crackdown on unofficial congregations has intensified since 2016, and that Christmas continues to be a difficult time. A former member of Shouwang Church, the largest unofficial Protestant congregation in the capital before it was shut in 2011, he recalls holding public Christmas celebrations with over 300 people a decade ago. Such an event would be impossible now, he said, adding that even festivities in official churches are subject to scrutiny.</p><p>“Every Christmas, police will monitor churches. I’ve never heard of anything dangerous happening, but they do it because they’re worried,” he said. Instead of celebrating on Christmas Eve or Christmas day this year, he plans to hold a gathering of fewer than 30 people after the holiday has passed.</p><h2>Christmas without Christ</h2><p>Despite China’s political wariness of Christmas, its commercial potential is unmissable. Secular decorations are ubiquitous in shopping malls, and the holiday is now promoted as a sort of hump-day shopping period between the retail bonanza of Singles’ Day on Nov. 11 and the Lunar New Year. China’s manufacturing sector has also built a $5.6 billion industry around the holiday, churning out fairy lights and other festive goods, Bloomberg reported (paywall). Production in the manufacturing hub of Yiwu alone accounts for 60% of the world’s Christmas decorations.</p><p>Overseas travel has also fueled China’s Christmas frenzy. In 2016, Finnish organizations partnered with Alibaba to launch a campaign promoting tourism to Finland, with the Santa village in Rovaniemi as one of its main attractions. The city was also designated as a “friendship town” of Harbin, the wintry capital of Heilongjiang province. In 2010, Xi, then vice president of China, went to Rovaniemi and posed for photos with Santa during an official visit.</p><p>Statistics from Visit Rovaniemi, which promotes the city as a tourist destination, show that registered overnight stays from Chinese visitors have rapidly increased in the past decade, from 3,300 visits in 2010 to 32,349 last year. Sanna Kärkkäinen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi, said the city set up an account (link in Chinese) for Santa on Chinese social network Weibo, and incorporated the Alipay payment system in 2016 to cater to Chinese tourists.</p><p>In the town’s main post office, letters from China in all shapes and sizes are stacked in a cabinet in the corner. Some are scrawled on colorful stationery and peppered with drawings of classic Christmas icons. Others are carefully written on rice paper in traditional Chinese calligraphy. Many are bilingual.</p><p>Most Chinese children may not be fully aware of Christmas’s religious background nor of China’s complicated relationship to the holiday. Still, the universal values of Christmas—generosity, hope, and gratitude—are what’s driving them to write to St. Nick.</p><p>Growing up in Beijing, Zhang first learned about Santa from elementary school teachers, who stressed he was nothing more than a fictional character of Western culture. Despite this, she became fascinated by the concept of Santa and began admiring the spirit of giving he represents—so much so that when she turned 19 in 2011, she decided to write him a letter.</p><p>“In China, we don’t have Christmas, and family is more important than gifts,” she wrote in both English and Chinese. ”But you know, one small present can mean so much to a child, and bring so much happiness. Although you don’t really exist, kindness does. In my heart, you represent kindness.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(7,'https://qz.com/1480126/taiwan-can-legalize-gay-marriage-with-another-law-post-referendum/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s LGBT community will have to settle for equal but different marriage laws','null',NULL,'Isabella Steger','2018-11-30T06:39:41.000Z',1543559981000,'<p>Taiwan’s LGBT community won’t be getting true marriage equality.</p><p>Following the defeat of referendums in support of same-sex marriage last weekend, Taiwan’s ruling party said yesterday (Nov. 29) that gay couples will be allowed to marry (link in Chinese) under the establishment of a separate law, rather than by revising the current law to redefine marriage following the votes.</p><p>Three motions put forward by conservative groups against gay marriage, including one that sought to restrict marriage to between a man and a woman, were all accepted. Opposing referendums submitted by pro-LGBT groups, including one that proposed rewriting the civil code to enshrine true marriage equality, failed. Supporters of same-sex marriage argue that unless the law is changed, gay couples will not be accorded the same benefits and legal protections as heterosexual couples.</p><p>Taiwan’s top court ruled in May 2017 that restricting marriage to a man and a woman was unconstitutional, and that marriage equality must be legalized within two years, either through changing the civil code or the implementation of a separate law. If no legislative action is taken, gay couples would be allowed to register their marriages automatically under existing law. Many felt hopeful Taiwan’s march to becoming the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage would proceed unimpeded, with president Tsai Ing-wen herself voicing support for marriage equality.</p><p>As time went on, however, it became clear that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was not going to take the initiative to follow through with any legislative action, as it tried to maintain popular support in the run-up to crucial local elections, which took place last weekend. That allowed conservative groups to whip up anti-LGBT sentiments in Taiwan—for example through the dissemination of misinformation on social media—and launch referendums in a bid to derail marriage equality. The DPP also suffered heavy losses in the local elections.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan and Gender Equity Education Coalition, umbrella groups promoting LGBT rights, said in a statement to Quartz that any new law allowing same-sex marriage should follow the ruling laid down by the constitutional court and protect the freedom to marry for gay couples, and called on the government to “end the chaos” and family divisions caused by the referendums.</p><p>Chi Jia-wei—a pioneer of gay rights in Taiwan and the plaintiff whose legal challenge brought about the court’s landmark decision—said that (link in Chinese) he would fully support the establishment of a separate law if the government and anti-marriage-equality groups would allow it to accord same-sex couples the same privileges given to heterosexual couples.</p><p>Taiwan’s chief justice Hsu Tzong-li added that (link in Chinese) the marital rights of sexual minorities are protected under Taiwan’s constitution. He noted that just because a separate law might be enacted doesn’t mean the rights of such couples were not equal if the law were designed appropriately.</p><p>This story has been updated with comment from the Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan and Gender Equity Education Coalition.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(8,'https://qz.com/1474097/taiwan-votes-against-same-sex-marriage-in-referendum/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s vote against same-sex marriage illustrates the problem with referendums','null',NULL,'Nikhil Sonnad','2018-11-25T16:59:02.000Z',1543165142000,'<p>Over the weekend, Taiwanese voters were asked to answer yes or no to this question, as part of a referendum: “Do you agree that Civil Code regulations should restrict marriage to being between a man and a woman?” The “yes” votes won, in a “a bitter blow and a step backwards for human rights in Taiwan,” according to Annie Huang of Amnesty International Taiwan.</p><p>It’s a step back because in 2017, Taiwan’s high court ruled that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples was unconstitutional. More broadly, though, the result is the latest example of how referendums can be deeply undemocratic.</p><p>The high court decision did not legalize same-sex marriage; it only declared that the legislature would have to make marriage equality law within two years. That meant it was up to Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which gained power in 2016, to follow through. It failed to do so.</p><p>That ineptitude provided an opportunity for groups in Taiwan opposed to marriage equality, led by conservative Christians. These groups took advantage of new rules, passed in 2017, that made it easier to hold and pass referendums. Previously in Taiwan, a referendum required signatures from 5% of the electorate in order to be placed on the ballot. That was reduced to 1.5%. And for a ballot measure to pass, it now only needs “yes” votes from 25% of the population, compared to the earlier 50%.</p><p>That is a low bar. Even though Christians make up just 5% of Taiwan’s population, they were able to collect the paltry 280,000 signatures needed to make their referendum happen. Their proposal to define marriage as “between a man and a woman” received over 7 million “yes” votes—more than a counter-referendum endorsing same-sex marriage, but far less than half of Taiwan’s over 18 million registered voters.</p><p>This liberal approach to referendums has backfired on the DPP—a left-leaning party that broadly supports LGBT rights—which originally pushed to relax the rules. When the new rules were announced, the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, called it a “historic moment” in which “people are the masters.”</p><p>But as the DPP has found out, that is far from the reality of referendums.</p><p>One problem with referendums is that they reduce highly complicated matters to a simple yes or no. The most consequential example of our time is, of course, Brexit. Because the European Union is a large, supranational entity, many British voters felt they had lost the ability to exert their political will. But to distill the nation’s entire relationship to its most important ally to a binary choice was short-sighted, and has led to the nightmare of defining what exactly Brexit is, saddening and angering just about everyone along the way.</p><p>The decision on marriage law in Taiwan reveals an even bigger problem with referendums, though: they turn politics into a popularity contest. Democracy is not just about voting, but also pluralism and the protection of minority rights. In deciding to call marriage discrimination unconstitutional, the court was acting to protect those rights for the LGBT community. Plus, given Taiwan’s law that a referendum needs only 25% of voters to say “yes,” it doesn’t even meet the standard of majority rule.</p><p>In 2017, the high court put Taiwan on the world stage as a model for other Asian nations on human rights issues. That reputation looks fragile now. Over the weekend, Tsai stepped down as party leader after the DPP suffered wider losses across the country. There is lots of blame to go around—blame Tsai and the DPP for not putting same-sex marriage into law, blame conservative groups who cannot tolerate ways of life other than their own. But also blame a political institution that puts the “will of the people” before the rights of the person.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(9,'https://qz.com/1473960/taiwans-elections-have-given-beijing-much-to-celebrate/','QUARTZ',NULL,'Taiwan’s elections have given Beijing much to celebrate','null',NULL,'Steve Mollman','2018-11-24T21:33:20.000Z',1543095200000,'<p>Local elections in Taiwan went poorly for the ruling party on Saturday (Nov. 24). But in China, Beijing has been given much to celebrate.</p><p>The independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost seven of the 13 cities and counties it currently holds to the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang (KMT). As a sign of how badly things went for the DPP, it lost Kaohsiung, in the south, despite holding it for decades. It also ceded Taichung, Taiwan’s second most populous city. The stinging results prompted Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen to resign as DPP chair Saturday.</p><p>China chalked up another win with voters’ rejection of a proposal  regarding the 2020 Olympics. The measure proposed using the name “Taiwan” when applying to compete in the contest, rather than  “Chinese Taipei.” China prefers the latter name because it considers Taiwan a renegade province, despite decades of democratic self-rule.</p><p>The elections are considered a status check for Tsai, who came to power two years ago at the expense of the KMT. Since assuming office she’s walked a fine line on relations with China, emphasizing Taiwan’s sovereignty while avoiding calls from within her party to move toward declaring formal separation from the mainland.</p><p>During her term, China has stepped up its military intimidation and undertaken various measures to undermine Taiwan’s economy and diplomatic standing. For example, it has restricted the flow of mainland tourists, and persuaded former diplomatic allies of Taiwan to cut off ties. Such pressure has hurt business confidence in Taiwan.</p><p>The KMT stresses economic ties with the mainland and eschews talk of going it alone. Beijing, not surprisingly, prefers it over the DPP.</p><p>“Certainly, I think the Chinese government would like to see the KMT come on strong in this election as a pointer to the presidential and legislative elections in 2020,” Michael Boyden, managing director at TASC Taiwan Asia Strategy Consulting, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Friday. “The trade relationship with China matters a great deal to many people here.”</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL),(10,'https://qz.com/1471411/chat-apps-like-line-spread-anti-lgbt-fake-news-before-taiwan-same-sex-marriage-vote/','QUARTZ',NULL,'How Taiwan battled fake anti-LGBT news before its vote on same-sex marriage','null',NULL,'Isabella Steger','2018-11-22T10:24:40.000Z',1542882280000,'<p>As Taiwan gears up to vote on same-sex marriage on Saturday (Nov. 24), its LGBT community has been battling a flood of misinformation proliferating across social media platforms like Line, the Japanese chat app that’s dominant in Taiwan.</p><p>The messages most likely to go viral are the ones that connect same-sex marriage with HIV, said Johnson Liang, the founder of CoFacts, a voluntary, collaborative chatbot for factchecking questionable messages being disseminated on Line. CoFact volunteers verify the content of messages and the bot then responds back to the Line user.</p><p>One example (link in Chinese) of a message that went “super viral” on Line last year, said Liang, is one titled “Strange! Why do they want to rush to legalize same-sex marriage?” The message, whose source is unknown, claims that Taiwan—which offers universal health-care—will become a magnet for HIV-positive homosexual men, who will flock to the country and marry a Taiwanese man in order to use the health-care system. Because of the high cost of treating HIV/AIDS, the ultimate beneficiaries will be drug companies while taxpayers and the health-care system will suffer, the message goes on to say.</p><p>Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Administration responded to (link in Chinese) these rumors last year, clarifying that the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment in Taiwan was not as high as the figure purported in these messages, and that foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens are not automatically entitled to free health-care as soon as they get married.</p><p>Like many other countries, Taiwan is facing serious problems with the spread of misinformation online—president Tsai Ing-wen even warned that in the run-up to crucial local elections this weekend, people need to be more vigilant about spreading fake news, and accused China of being the source of some of these messages in order to create divisions in Taiwanese society.</p><h2>“Touch, click, select, and forward”</h2><p>The volume of misinformation against Taiwan’s LGBT community has noticeably increased in recent months as the country prepares to vote in a number of referendums relating to the legalization of same-sex marriage, said Benson Lee, spokesman for the organization Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan, an umbrella LGBT group that gathered the 280,000 signatures required to place an issue on the ballot. They’re asking Taiwan’s nearly 20 million voters if they support changing civil law, which currently defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, to allow same-sex unions.</p><p>Other referendums before voters ask if marriage should remain between a man and a woman, as it currently is.</p><p>Lee said that some organizations intentionally create and spread falsehoods, while “panicking and anxious” parents contribute to its spread by being too quick to share it.</p><p>In October, France’s de facto embassy in Taiwan—the island has official ties with less than two dozen nations—had to issue a statement to refute messages spreading around (link in Chinese) Taiwan’s internet that claimed that 200,000 people had protested in France demanding that the country roll back same-sex marriage. The Bureau Français de Taipei said in a Facebook post that there has been no such large-scale protest against gay marriage in the country, and reiterated France’s commitment to equal rights for all regardless of sexual orientation.</p><p>In a talk delivered earlier this year, Wu Ming-hsuan, an activist and member of the g0v tech community in Taiwan, said that a major factor explaining the proliferation of fake news and misinformation in Taiwan was the prominence of closed messaging groups on Line or Facebook, where many people, particularly the elderly—many of whom had never used the internet before—simply “touch, click, select, and forward” messages.</p><p>Line, which is also popular in Southeast Asian nations like Thailand and Indonesia, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on what it’s doing to weed out misinformation in Taiwan. Earlier this year, the platform said it was taking steps like allowing users to report spoof accounts and working with some government authorities to combat misinformation in Thailand.</p><h2>Playing with parental anxieties</h2><p>Saturday’s referendums come after lawmakers did little to implement a May 2017 ruling from Taiwan’s top court that found same-sex marriage to be a constitutional right, ordering that the law be changed by May 2019.</p><p>Conservative groups mobilized against the ruling and now hope to use the plebiscites to stymie the advance of marriage equality. Supporters of same-sex marriage fear that a referendum result that goes the way of the conservative groups could result in the government introducing a watered-down version of marriage that leaves gay couples “equal but different,” through the creation of a same-sex partnership law that gives legal protections inferior to those in heterosexual marriages.</p><p>They hope instead that the government will amend Taiwan’s civil code so that marriage is no longer defined as being between a man and a woman. Just weeks ahead of the vote, tens of thousands gathered for Taiwan’s pride march last month, the biggest in Asia.</p><p>One of the referendum questions submitted by conservative group Happiness of the Next Generation Alliance also seeks to ban references to homosexuality in Taiwan’s gender-inclusive curriculum in elementary and high schools, and some of the misinformation has particularly targeted parents.</p><p>A leaflet from a conservative group that was placed in mailboxes in Taiwan, supplied to Quartz by a member of Taiwan’s LGBT community, said that “based on the meaning of the rainbow flag,” legalizing same-sex marriage would make it legal to have sex with minors under 16. Voting in favor of marriage equality means “paving the way for pedophilia,” said the leaflet, adding that “children are the treasure of the country’s future, what kind of parent would want this to happen?”</p><p>Another video that spread on Facebook in January 2017 shows a group of protesters supporting a mother who said that because of Taiwan’s gender-inclusive, progressive curriculum, her child was taught how to masturbate in class alongside students of the opposite sex. The woman claimed that she was the victim of smearing campaigns by groups supporting marriage equality.</p><p>Geoff, a US-based graduate student in the US in his 30s who only wanted to be identified by his first name, said that his family members in Taiwan have been “forwarding without filtering” messages of misinformation against LGBT people on Line. He said he tried to offer counter information against those messages, but felt like he was fighting a “losing war.” Now, he says, he’s “checked out entirely” from those chat groups.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL);

Beijing’s malign influence is apparent everywhere, while the United States is seen as largely absent. Washington must wake up to the danger of China’s massive effort to infiltrate, undermine and eventually abolish Taiwan’s democracy.</p><p>Tsai called for Washington’s help to confront Beijing’s comprehensive campaign to exert control over Taiwanese politics and society, which is steadily eroding a 40-year status quo that has kept a shaky peace. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which governs the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, stipulates that the United States will “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.”</p><p>In 2019, those words ring hollow. Xi Jinping’s government brazenly uses economic and political pressure to interfere in Taiwan — an attempt to turn the Taiwanese people and their leaders toward Beijing and against the West. Xi himself smashed the status quo in January when he publicly called for Taiwan to rejoin China under the “One Country, Two Systems” model. One look at Hong Kong should be enough for any Taiwanese citizen to realize that means a steady erosion of their freedoms and sovereignty.</p><p>During interviews with Taiwanese politicians, officials and national security experts, our delegation in Taiwan, organized by the East West Center, heard grave warnings. Following its successful interference effort in last November’s local elections, Beijing is now focused intensely on ousting Tsai and her Democratic People’s Party in next January’s presidential contest.</p><p>“Next year’s election might be the last meaningful election in Taiwan. After that, it will be a Hong Kong-style election,” said Chen Ming-Chi, deputy minister of the Mainland Affairs Council. If China succeeds in returning the Beijing-sympathetic Nationalist Party (KMT) to power, that could be the tipping point after which Taiwan can never again exert its own sovereignty, he said. “2020 would be the beginning of the reunification.”</p><p>In other words, a Chinese military invasion is no longer the scenario Taiwanese fear most. China’s strategy to take over Taiwan is focused now on the hybrid warfare tactics authoritarian regimes increasingly deploy in free societies. Pro-Beijing interests have bought up a huge portion of Taiwanese media and coordinate with Beijing to spread propaganda and fake news and manipulate social media.</p><p>The Chinese government uses economic coercion to both recruit and punish Taiwanese leaders. Meanwhile, China is working overtime to strip Taiwan of its diplomatic allies and keep it out of multilateral institutions. Beijing is literally trying to erase the country from the map.</p><p>Taiwan is the testing ground for these methods, but China is now exporting them to other places, including the United States. That’s a threat not just to Taiwan but also to democracies worldwide, said Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien.</p><p>“Taiwan is only the beginning,” he said. “They want their new civilization to become a new global order. That’s what they are thinking. And together with an expansion of their physical power, now they are putting their dreams into reality.”</p><p>Several KMT officials and former officials told our delegation fears of China were overblown and seeking accommodation with Beijing was the only reasonable approach. Former deputy foreign minister Bruce Linghu said the KMT is not “pro-China” but rather “pro-peace.”</p><p>“Taiwan has to play it smart,” he said. “Why should we be provocative with China?”</p><p>KMT officials insist they support the U.S.-China relationship and are not trying to appease Beijing. But actions speak louder than words. While Tsai was speaking to Americans, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, a rising KMT leader and presidential prospect, was holding controversial meetings with Chinese Communist Party officials in Hong Kong and Macau. It’s clear which relationship the KMT prioritizes.</p><p>The U.S. interest in helping the current Taiwanese government defend its democracy from Chinese interference and aggression is understood — but our will is under question. The Trump administration, despite being full of pro-Taiwan officials, has been inconsistent. There’s progress on arms sales but no progress on what Tsai wants most, a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement. There’s not enough U.S. support for Taiwan’s fight against China’s hybrid warfare approach.</p><p>In reality, accommodation with Beijing likely won’t work and China’s appetite in Taiwan will only grow with the eating. Taiwan proves that democracy and Chinese culture can work together and that prosperity need not require repression. This is an example that Beijing, for obvious reasons, cannot tolerate. Taiwan’s very existence plays into the Chinese Communist Party’s deep insecurity.</p><p>But time is running out fast for the United States to show the Taiwanese people they have international support for refusing to acquiesce to Beijing’s dominance over their politics, economy and society.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iKiT6jz4mTtc72W7Q5JpareHIFs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56HRNICRSII6TCFB5U2G6DWJJ4.jpg'),(4,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/taiwans-tsai-confirms-request-to-buy-new-us-fighters-tanks/2019/03/28/f0af9308-510f-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Taiwan’s Tsai confirms request to buy new US fighters, tanks',NULL,NULL,'Christopher Bodeen | AP','1553768547000',1553768547000,'<p>BEIJING — Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said her government has asked to purchase advanced new fighter jets and tanks from the U.S., a request that if approved, could set off new tensions between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Beijing considers self-governing Taiwan part of China, to be annexed by force if necessary.

Well, sort of. It has a constitution, an army and an elected government, and yet the United Nations doesn’t recognize it. The reason? Taiwan became the home base of Chinese who fled Communism in the 1940s, and China considers the island one of its provinces, the government as illegitimate and any talk of independence as deeply hostile. China blasted missiles into the waters surrounding Taiwan in the mid-1990s as a warning not to go it alone. Relations and trade links have strengthened since then, but Taiwan’s first female president, leader of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, has come to power at a time when China is growing more assertive.</p><p>The Situation</p><p>Elected in a landslide in 2016, President Tsai Ing-wen pledged peaceful ties with China even as she resisted pressure from the mainland to support the “one-China principle” — the understanding that both sides belong to one China, even if they have different ideas about what that means. The Beijing government considers itself the rightful ruler of Taiwan, even though the island has been governed separately since 1949. In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested that groups and individuals in mainland China and Taiwan who support the “one China” framework enter into “in-depth democratic consultations” and work toward unification  — the clearest sign yet that he wants the 70-year dispute settled during his tenure. His comments came a day after Tsai warned against continued threats from China. Taiwan under Tsai — whose party supports achieving full independence — has pursued closer ties with the U.S., including the resumption of high-level U.S. official visits to Taiwan, which President Donald Trump signed into law.  In March, the Trump administration indicated it may sell fighter jets to Taiwan, a move that would incense China. Xi has warned that efforts to widen divisions with Taiwan would be “punished by history” and that his country had the capabilities to stop any attempt at independence. China has picked off Taiwan’s few remaining allies, launched regular “encirclement patrols” with military jets around Taiwan’s airspace and pressured international airlines into listing Taiwan as part of China. Tsai’s party suffered heavy losses in local elections to the China-friendly opposition in November, raising questions about her prospects in the general election in January 2020. </p><p>The Background</p><p>Victory by the Communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949 forced the nationalist Kuomintang government to flee the mainland and cross the 110-mile Taiwan Strait along with more than 1.5 million refugees. Staunch U.S. support mellowed in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon shifted America’s diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in an effort to contain the Soviet Union. Even so, America passed a 1979 law committing to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait and facilitate arms sales to the island democracy. After 38 years of often brutal rule, Taiwan dropped martial law in 1987 and a year later got its first native-born president, who went on to become its first democratically elected leader in 1996. Tensions erupted into Chinese military action twice — in the 1950s then again around a Taiwan election in the mid-1990s. China passed a law in 2005 authorizing an attack if the island declares independence. Even with only a handful of nations recognizing Taiwan, its 23.6 million people have built their economy into a technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Average income is three times greater than that of China. Much of Apple’s iPhone is made by Taiwanese companies, while tech giants including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company lead the world in making computer chips for other firms.</p><p>The Argument</p><p>China aims more than 1,200 missiles at Taiwan and no peace treaty has been signed in the seven decades since the governments split. While many China-watchers say there is too much at stake for military confrontation, especially given the prospect of U.S. involvement and possible economic fallout, Trump’s election has added a degree of uncertainty to old assumptions. China’s actions in Asia’s disputed waters have indicated a more expansionist and aggressive regional stance. Taiwan’s voters, wary of the lack of political freedom in China, turned to Tsai to keep the peace while building international ties — something of a challenge given its neighbor’s influence — with a view to a future less dependent on the mainland. </p><p>To contact the authors of this QuickTake: Debra Mao in Hong Kong at dmao5@bloomberg.netSamson Ellis in Taipei at sellis29@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this QuickTake: Grant Clark at gclark@bloomberg.net</p><p>First published Jan. 10, 2016</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fzXgSDVAyp2Awu6hd2cYmkrEXZs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCUTO6CMLII6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg'),(6,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/rough-straits-in-the-china-taiwan-relationship/2019/03/06/95abcd04-3e78-11e9-85ad-779ef05fd9d8_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Rough straits in the China-Taiwan relationship',NULL,NULL,'Letters to the Editor','1551911613000',1551911613000,'<p>Regarding the Feb. 26 news article “Taiwan’s 2020 election campaign is all about Washington vs. Beijing”:</p><p>The article said Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen may have signaled that Taiwan is “a bulwark against Chinese expansionism” in East Asia.

Ms. Tsai takes a confrontational approach by not recognizing the 1992 consensus between Taipei and Beijing, namely “one China, respective interpretations,” making cross-strait relations rather difficult to manage and harming Taiwan’s economy and diplomatic relations. These issues will likely be hotly debated in the forthcoming presidential campaign. </p><p>Given the fierce competition between the United States and mainland China lately, the people of Taiwan are increasingly worried that Taiwan may be used as a bargaining chip in the process.

(Cheng’s late husband, Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton economist and health-care expert, had been the one to recommend a single-payer system to the country in the 1980s.)</p><p>The country is home to about 24 million people and is the world’s 19th-largest economy; 99.9 percent of its residents are enrolled in the national health-care program, regardless of preexisting conditions.</p><p>“Comprehensive benefits include inpatient and outpatient care, mental health care, prescription drugs, dental care, Chinese medicine, dialysis, and day care for the elderly,” Cheng notes.</p><p>She continues:</p><p>About 6.1 percent of the GDP in Taiwan is spent on health care; in the United States, one of the highest levels of a developed country, it’s about 17 percent.</p><p>In an interview, Cheng gave examples of price disparities between the United States and Taiwan, based on statistics from insurance companies and government agencies.</p><p>Harvoni, a drug to treat hepatitis C, costs $2,132 for a course of treatment in Taiwan; in the United States, the same amount costs an average of $32,114, she said.</p><p>An MRI costs $288 in Taiwan; in the United States, it’s $1,119.</p><p>A C-section costs $1,404 in Taiwan; in the United States, it’s $15,106.</p><p>Interest in Taiwan’s health-care system has been surging in recent years.

Many, many countries that are looking to cover everyone — they are looking to Taiwan’s model as a guide.”</p><p>Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative think tank American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said inflated U.S. health-care costs were in part the result of a “pattern of overutilization of some things like excessive testing and underutilization of preventive care.”</p><p>\"You add it all up, it costs a lot,” he said.</p><p>Holtz-Eakin said a recent study of prices looked at 23 drugs and found they cost 80 percent more in the United States than other places. Still, 11 of those drugs were available in every other country in the study, Holtz-Eakin said.</p><p>“So one of the prices you pay in another country is you don’t get access to some diagnoses and therapies,” he said. “It’s hard to put a price tag on that.”</p><p>[An 11-year-old pleaded for an abortion after she was raped.

But he said it would not rule out using military force.</p><p>Speaking to reporters last week, Tsai maintained that Taiwan wanted an “independent existence” and said it should seek allies abroad to counter its giant neighbor rather than appease it.</p><p>“We want a flourishing economy, we want security, but we also want democracy,” she said. “A president, aside from being responsible for maintaining the homeland’s security, also should push Taiwan toward the international world, and let generations of Taiwanese have the freedom of self-determination.”</p><p>Her pitch, however, may not get much traction.</p><p>Tsai’s party was dealt heavy defeats in local elections in November, and Tsai is lagging behind potential challengers who favor closer ties to China, according to opinion polls by National Chengchi University’s Election Study Center and Shih Hsin University.</p><p>Her chief opponents are Eric Chu and Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT), and Ko Wen-je, the independent mayor of Taipei.</p><p>[China’s Xi calls unification with Taiwan inevitable]</p><p>The KMT’s chair, Wu Den-yih, has said his party will seek a peace treaty with Beijing if it wins the presidency next January.

Days later, State Department official Alex Wong traveled to Taipei to deliver a speech that irked Beijing. Days after last November’s election in Taiwan, U.S. Navy warships steamed through the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>“There is more discussion in the government about Taiwan than ever before on a range of issues, from economic to defense to diplomatic,” said Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p>U.S. officials are open to deepening trade ties with Taiwan, although it’s not clear that Tsai has the domestic political capital to close deals, Glaser added.</p><p>Taiwan’s campaign season will play out under a cloud of high tension.</p><p>“China is getting impatient about lack of progress on Taiwan, and there are plenty of indicators of that, in the rhetorical arena but also in terms of ongoing military preparations and pressures put on Taiwan internationally,” said Jonathan Sullivan of Britain’s University of Nottingham.</p><p>Xi has expressed reluctance to let what he calls the “Taiwan problem” be “passed down from generation to generation” and has framed the assertion of Chinese territorial claims as central to his mission of restoring China’s national greatness.</p><p>The Chinese leader has ushered along a vast military modernization campaign aimed at taking Taiwan, encircled the island with bombers and ships in displays of force, and urged his commanders to prepare for combat.</p><p>U.S. defense intelligence officials said last month they were concerned that the Chinese military’s upgrades were approaching the point where its commanders may tell Xi that they are confident they could successfully invade Taiwan.</p><p>In an editorial last week, the Chinese Communist Party-run Global Times newspaper warned Tsai against “wicked tricks” on the campaign trail — referring to the possibility that she might stoke pro-independence fervor to win votes.</p><p>“If she does, we have to respond and attack this kind of arrogant aggression,” the editorial said. “We have to work hard to increasingly establish boundaries on Taiwan’s electoral activities.

He told an audience Tuesday night that he praised China’s President Xi Jinping by calling him the “king” of China to his face.</p><p>“He said, \'But I am not king, I am president.’ I said ‘No, you’re president for life, and therefore you’re king,’ ” Trump recounted from his 2017 trip to Beijing. “He said, huh. He liked that. I get along with him great.”</p><p>The way Trump tells the story, he seems envious that the Chinese government changed its constitution in March 2018 to remove term limits for presidents, essentially allowing Xi to stay on as the head of the Chinese government in perpetuity.</p><p>But China’s steady slide toward totalitarian rule is the exact opposite of what’s in the interests of the United States and the world, not to mention the Chinese people. The concentration of power by Xi and his cohorts goes hand in hand with the Chinese Communist Party’s rising internal repression and external aggression.</p><p>On a journalism fellowship last week in Taiwan — the only Chinese-speaking democracy on earth — our delegation asked Foreign Minister Joseph Wu what would happen if China were to become a democracy instead of a dictatorship.</p><p>“If we think about the possibility that China is going to change itself into a democracy, I think it’s a blessing for the rest of the world,” Wu said.</p><p>A democratic China would be more focused on its own internal development than on expansionism, Wu argued. For Taiwan — which is on the front lines of China’s economic, political and diplomatic aggression — a democratic China would be less threatening and less intent on convincing Chinese people and the world that Taiwan is a territory they need to recover.</p><p>“And for the Taiwanese people’s reaction to China becoming a democracy, we would congratulate the Chinese people that they will be able to enjoy the same degree of freedom and human rights protection as Taiwan,” Wu said. “That’s a good thing for them.”</p><p>Wu was answering a question about a hypothetical situation; nobody thinks democracy in China is going to break out any time soon. June will mark the 30th anniversary of the Chinese government’s 1989 massacre of thousands of pro-democracy advocates in Tiananmen Square, and the CCP has kept its foot on the neck of the movement ever since.</p><p>But Taiwan’s situation should be a warning to the rest of the world that China’s intention is to undermine and eventually erode democracy and the values it represents, Wu said.</p><p>“Taiwan’s democracy is something that we need to treasure, and China’s intention is to destroy Taiwan’s democracy,” he said. “We have to prevail, because we have to show the international community that democracy is a better path for mankind.”</p><p>Of course, official U.S. foreign policy is to support Taiwan’s democracy and push for political reform in China. “Taiwan is a democratic success story, a reliable partner and a force for good in the world,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in February.</p><p>But Trump’s praise of Xi’s power grab undermines that message. Wu said that it’s in the nature of authoritarian regimes to be externally aggressive and internally repressive, attacking all freedoms, including religion.</p><p>“Look at their suppression of the Catholics,” he said. “It is because the churches [are] the best way of organizing the public, and the Chinese government is very fearful of that.”</p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Hsu Szu-chien told our delegation that China’s increasing authoritarianism is not just a problem for China and Taiwan, but for all democracies. Beijing is increasingly exporting its repression to free societies, including by attempting to force Western corporations such as airlines to erase the word “Taiwan” from their websites.</p><p>“Changing the name of Taiwan is not only about Taiwan, it’s about bending democracies’ will,” Hsu said. “I think everyone in democracies around the world should wake up to that.”</p><p>No one is advocating for regime change policies in China, but the Chinese people’s demands for greater freedoms are not going away, either. As the famous Chinese democracy activist Wei Jingsheng wrote in “The Fifth Modernization,” a 1978 document that cost him 18 years in prison and permanent exile:</p><p>“People should have democracy. When they ask for democracy, they are only demanding what is rightfully theirs. Anyone refusing to give it to them is a shameless bandit no better than a capitalist who robs workers of their money earned with their sweat and blood. Do the people have democracy now? No. Do they want to be masters of their own destiny? Definitely yes.”</p><p>Trump will never be a champion of democracy. But the least he could do is avoid praising Xi for grabbing power and then bragging about that to a group of donors. He’s working against the interests of both the Chinese people and the United States.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qcQ5lNwUrJcNYe2avGWm-MarXPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLHCXBC6IMI6RNSWENWGEFHPAE.jpg'),(10,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/18/chinas-xi-jinping-is-growing-impatient-with-taiwan-adding-tensions-with-united-states/','The Washington Post',NULL,'China\'s Xi Jinping is growing impatient with Taiwan, adding to tensions with U.S.',NULL,NULL,'John Pomfret','1550524026000',1550524026000,'<p>As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election less than a year from now, it looks increasingly likely that the island democracy risks replaying its traditional role as a flash point in U.S.-China relations.</p><p>On Feb. 7, a group of four Republican senators called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to invite Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, to address a joint session of Congress — a move that would enrage Beijing. Hard-line Chinese analysts have issued a report advocating that Beijing take a page from American policy in Venezuela and recognize as Taiwan’s next president any candidate who supports unification. In Taiwan, a group of uncompromising independence activists are lobbying their government to “create [an] independent state and advance towards being a normal country” next year. Beijing has warned that any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan would result in war.</p><p>These maneuvers are occurring against a backdrop of a deteriorating relationship between the Trump administration and Beijing, and as China’s president, Xi Jinping, seems anxious for movement on Taiwan.</p><p>Beijing has always claimed that Taiwan is part of China and has never dropped its threat to use force to “unite the motherland.” For its part, the United States’ one-China policy acknowledges Beijing’s position that there is only one China, but Washington has never taken a position on whether Taiwan belongs to the People’s Republic of China. What’s more, under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed in 1979, the United States is legally obligated to provide for Taiwan’s defense.</p><p>For decades, Chinese officials privately argued that with time and Chinese economic growth Taiwan would have no choice but to accept China’s embrace. Now Chinese analysts are far more pessimistic. First, there had been an assumption in some circles that China’s political system would evolve into a more liberal one, making a confederation with China a palpable option for many on Taiwan. But instead, China today is more repressive than at any time since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests around Tiananmen Square.</p><p>Second, many Taiwanese have been turned off by China’s handling of Hong Kong, which they see as a harbinger of things to come in Taiwan should China take control. China absorbed the former British colony in 1997, promising — under the slogan “one country, two systems” — to let it maintain its unique economic system for 50 years and pledging to allow more democracy. Twenty-two years into Chinese rule and Beijing has not significantly expanded democracy in Hong Kong and has begun to meddle openly in the internal affairs of the territory.</p><p>Finally, after almost 30 years of democratization in Taiwan, many Taiwanese have discovered a unique identity and have no interest in unifying with Beijing. In 1992, when democracy just began in Taiwan, only 20 percent of the respondents to an annual poll held by Taiwan’s National Chengchi University called themselves “Taiwanese only.” In 2018, more than 50 percent did so. And those who identified solely as Chinese dropped from a quarter of those asked in 1992 to less than 3 percent last year.</p><p>Faced with these trends, Xi has apparently decided that saber rattling is better than a soft touch. On Jan. 2, in his first major speech on Taiwan since taking over the leadership of the Communist Party in 2012, he warned that the Taiwan “problem” could not be put off for another generation and threatened the island with attack. He also demanded that any talks between Taiwan and China must be carried out with both sides acknowledging that the ultimate goal would be unification. Xi’s speech prompted a rarely seen show of political unity in Taiwan. Both President Tsai, who represents the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, and the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, rejected Xi’s demands.</p><p>Xi’s tougher line has garnered support among hard-liners in China. In a report given to me by a prominent hard-liner who requested anonymity, one group suggested somewhat implausibly that should China decide to attack Taiwan, it could persuade Russia, North Korea and Iran to join the fight. The report also advocated launching an economic embargo on Taiwan by first drawing up a list of Taiwanese independence supporters and blocking them from doing business in China.</p><p>The Financial Times recently reported that officials from China’s Taiwan Affairs Council have been calling in mainland-based Taiwanese business executives and Taiwanese students for discussions on Taiwan’s fate. Taiwanese who participated in these sessions described them as a way to gauge the political reliability of Taiwanese living in China. The hard-liners’ report called on the Chinese government to find a leader on Taiwan willing to accept Chinese rule recognize him or her, as the United States has with Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó.</p><p>This type of extremism has echoes in Taiwan, where independence activists are chafing at Tsai’s moderate stance. Following defeats for the Democratic Progressive Party in local elections in November, independence advocates, led by Kuo Pei-hung, chairman of pro-independence Formosa TV, established an organization called the Formosa Alliance to push independence and organize a referendum on the topic.</p><p>Back in Washington, support for Taiwan is at its highest since the passing of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. Former diplomat Richard C. Bush, now at the Brookings Institution, predicted that inviting Taiwan’s president to Congress would inflame Beijing. Others are less alarmed.</p><p>Regardless, Taiwan, which has lain dormant for years as an issue between the United States and China, is back.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rSl5Z_4dZHeDCEjo9WkWo4klHXQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWKMMKBIW4I6TEDOTVK3MRI6WQ.jpg'),(11,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/recent-developments-surrounding-the-south-china-sea/2019/04/01/3a9cc018-544d-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html','The Washington Post',NULL,'Recent developments surrounding the South China Sea',NULL,NULL,'Christopher Bodeen | AP','1554102629000',1554102629000,'<p>BEIJING — A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:</p><p>___</p><p>EDITOR’S NOTE: This is a weekly look at developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts in the region.</p><p>___</p><p>TAIWAN PROTESTS CHINESE MILITARY AIRCRAFT CROSSING TAIWAN STRAIT CENTER LINE</p><p>Taiwan says its planes warned off Chinese military aircraft that crossed the center line in the Taiwan Strait, calling China’s move a provocation that seeks to alter the status quo in the waterway dividing the island from mainland China.</p><p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said a pair of Chinese J-11 jet fighters crossed the line around 11 a.m. Sunday and entered the island’s southwestern airspace.

Inventory figures at Apple’s primary chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. were also high at the end of 2018, up 40 percent from a year earlier.</p><p>At the time, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told me that stockpiles consisted primarily of raw wafers and 7-nanometer chips in production. In layman’s terms: the basic ingredient upon which chips are built, and semiconductors made with the latest technology. In the fourth quarter, Apple was the primary client for such technology.</p><p>That revelation came soon after Apple cut its own outlook for the period, citing weaker demand. Impressively, the iPhone maker managed its inventory so well that the figure climbed a mere 12.8 percent at the end of December from a year earlier – one of the slowest clips in recent quarters, and in the face of falling sales.</p><p>My conclusion in January was that, to avoid holding inventory, Apple was pushing it back onto suppliers. Ho declined to name the client, but she said that customers may ask TSMC to keep product on its shelves (and books) even if a chip has finished production and passed all required tests.</p><p>Foxconn’s major subsidiary, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., takes a long time to report its financials, which is why we didn’t get to view its year-end numbers until now. Maybe this delay diminishes the usefulness of this data, or the situation has improved during the interceding first quarter.</p><p>Nevertheless, these Hon Hai figures are further evidence of Apple’s inventory strategy.</p><p>The Chinese government also looks to be inadvertently helping Apple trim its stockpiles. In March Beijing announced it would cut the value-added tax rate to help buoy the economy. Apple started passing those savings on to consumers, Caixing reported, citing data from e-commerce companies and Apple’s own China website. The company already lowered prices in February, but the levy cut allowed it to trim again with a minimal hit to margins.</p><p>Over the past few months, suppliers throughout the hardware sector have spoken of moves to lower output in order to digest excess inventory. The result will be a particularly deep trough for the March-quarter cyclical low season.</p><p>If Hon Hai’s figures are anything to go by, the first quarter is likely to be one of austerity, in the hope that taking one for Team Apple will be rewarded with a rebound later.

Such projects are not always driven by “good intentions,” he said.</p><p>In a coup for Beijing, Panama switched diplomatic recognition in June 2017 to China from Taiwan, the self-ruled island the communist mainland claims as its own territory.

It’s worth knowing, and growing, these others.',NULL,NULL,'Adrian Higgins','1554331756000',1554331756000,'<p>The Japanese flowering cherry trees now in serene flower around the Tidal Basin are, for the most part, clones of a single plant favored in 19th-century Tokyo and named Somei-Yoshino.</p><p>It is easy to see their appeal; the blossoms each consist of a simple, creamy collar of silken petals around a yellow stamen. They seem pure and natural, even if they are the end product of centuries of hybridizing in Japan.</p><p>The tree canopies spread agreeably with age, and by blooming in unison (as clones) they create an enchanting blush-white cloud that floats above the water. When they are done, they fall in an extended shower of confetti that is nothing short of magical.</p><p>This monocultural artistic effect comes with some risk: If you plant the genetically identical plant en masse, you are raising the risk of it being wiped out by a new pest or disease. But that view is probably too dire; on paper cherry trees are beset with all manner of pernicious maladies, and yet they survive. The biggest threat to the Potomac Park cherry trees is us; all those feet squash the life out of the soil and the roots.</p><p>The short-lived blossoms are viewed in their native land as a symbol of the fleeting nature of our lives. The challenge of the Tidal Basin Yoshinos is in trying to meditate on this profundity in the company of thousands of other cherry-peepers. Many are, no doubt, sensitive types seeking a soulful experience, but others lack introspective sensibilities, and some believe an experience is only real if it is seen through the veil of a smartphone.</p><p>On balance, the hordes are all to the good. The greater the number of people connecting to nature, the better the prospects for the planet, I say.</p><p>And it is not just in Washington where mass plantings of trees produce appreciative crowds. In her new book, “The Sakura Obsession,” Naoko Abe recounts the ritual of cherry-viewing or hanami. Her journalist colleagues in Tokyo would send an assistant to stake out a spot under the trees in the afternoon, and by the evening, they had joined him for a raucous, sake-fueled celebration. Across the land, millions do the same.</p><p>From a gardener’s perspective, the surfeit of Yoshinos means we may be missing out on all the other Japanese flowering cherry tree selections, hybrids and varieties that are waiting to please us. Some of these cherries, I point out, are inferior to Yoshino. The weeping ones grafted high on a cherry stick live up to their name. When I see one, I want to weep.</p><p>More than 10 percent of the trees in Potomac Park are of the mid-April flowering Kwanzan or Kanzan cherry, which to my mind is a dud: too coarse in structure, too blowzy in its double flower, too strong in color. The flower effect is diluted by the burgeoning foliage. If the Yoshino draws us to the Elysian fields, the Kwanzan barks the penny arcade.</p><p>If I were to plant a cherry tree, I might pick Accolade, a hybrid between the Sargent and Higan cherry that is vigorous and yet delicate in its blushed, semi-double blossoms.</p><p>Dream Catcher is more upright in habit than Yoshino (useful for small urban gardens) and as a seedling selection of the Okame cherry blooms earlier, as well.</p><p>Helen Taft, named after the first lady behind the Tidal Basin plantings, is a cross between the Yoshino and Taiwan cherries. It blooms at the very threshold of spring and is smothered in pale pink single blossoms that darken after a few days.</p><p>First Lady, another in the series, is strongly upright with dark glossy leaves and abundant dark rose-pink blooms redolent of the Taiwan cherry. This hybrid, which grows to 27 feet high and 14 feet across after 20 years, has proven the most popular, Pooler says.</p><p>The reliance on Yoshino is understandable, given its grace, and it has mesmerized not just Washington. In major public plantings in postwar Japan, the Yoshino became predominant. Abe is not entirely happy with this. In her book she points out that some 400 varieties of cherry have been bred from a handful of species over the past 1,200 years. Most of the world knew nothing of these beauties until Japan opened to the West in the mid-19th century. Suddenly confronted with these treasures, cities such as Washington naturally went crazy for them.</p><p>She recounts almost 50 cherry varieties. Her beef isn’t with Yoshinos, per se, but the fact that a militarized Japan in the 1920s and 1930s co-opted the plant as a symbol of noble death in the service of a belligerent state. On the eve of their mission, kamikaze pilots would get together and sing “Doki no Sakura” — Cherry Blossom Brothers.</p><p>But the book’s main and happier thrust is the recognition of an English plantsman — Collingwood Ingram — who became a noted guardian of the Japanese flowering cherry from his garden in Kent. He introduced some 50 varieties to the West and bred the Okame cherry tree, favored for its upright habit and early flowering. Perhaps his greatest feat was in preserving the Great White cherry and returning it to Japan, where it was known as Taihaku and then lost to cultivation. It is noted for its large, single white blossoms.</p><p>His initial efforts to send scions to Japan failed — they arrived dried out and dead. But he sent another batch embedded in potatoes, and they survived. There you have it, an Englishman using a South American tuber to restore an ancient Asian cherry to its homeland. That has to be a message about the power of the cherry tree to bring people together. The same cherry blossom dance is afoot, joyfully, this week on the banks of the Potomac.</p><p>@adrian_higgins on Twitter </p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RXBJ4Q0xr2Rf7lCVzhlMAIg_5K0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D76RVTR7REI6TE3BGAP7WW6V4Y.jpg'),(15,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/26/when-it-comes-negotiating-with-china-devil-is-details/','The Washington Post',NULL,'When it comes to negotiating with China, the devil is in the details',NULL,NULL,'Neil Thomas','1553625124000',1553625124000,'<p>President Trump may soon have himself a deal.</p><p>After years of criticizing China for “ripping us off” with “unfair trade practices,” and after a months-long trade war involving more than $360 billion in two-way tariffs, Trump is optimistic about announcing an economic accord with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit that could happen as early as late April.</p><p>The good news is that Trump’s negotiators appear to have won concessions from China on removing requirements for foreign firms to enter joint ventures with local entities and banning forced technology transfer. They are also moving toward an enforcement mechanism that might finally do something to curb rampant Chinese intellectual-property theft and protectionism that costs U.S. firms an estimated $50 billion a year.</p><p>But much work remains, not least Beijing’s translation of the draft agreement into Chinese, as the two sides have so far operated only in English. Many observers worry that China could water down its commitments by inserting vague language into the final text. As negotiations over U.S.-China normalization in the late 1970s show, the Trump administration must be vigilant about policing the faithfulness of the Chinese text, lest it become a backdoor vehicle for undermining the deal.</p><p>In December 1978, in their rush to normalize bilateral ties with China, U.S. diplomats blundered by allowing Beijing to slip an important change into the Chinese text of the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations. This normalization communique was hailed as a “historic development,” marking the end of three decades of isolation and of official U.S. recognition for Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers to be a renegade province. Historian Enrico Fardella calls this normalization President Jimmy Carter’s “greatest success.” Indeed, the American opening to China was a key moment in the United States’ Cold War maneuvering against the Soviet Union.</p><p>However, on Jan. 3, 1979, Michel Oksenberg, a China specialist on the National Security Council, sent a remarkable memo to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s national security adviser, to warn about a “translation problem” in the normalization communique.</p><p>That problem boiled down to one word: “acknowledge.” In the 1972 Shanghai Communique, the foundational document of U.S.-China relations, the United States said that it “acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.”</p><p>This noncommittal language was crucial, because Washington wanted to pursue its own One-China policy, whereby the United States acknowledged but did not accept either Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan or any Taiwanese claim to statehood. Similarly, then, the normalization communique stated that the U.S. government “acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.”</p><p>But while the English word, “acknowledges,” is the same in both documents, in translation it turned into something different. The Shanghai Communique used the word-phrase “renshi dao” (认识到), which connotes knowledge and understanding, whereas the normalization communique used the verb “chengren” (承认), a stronger term that connotes recognition and assent.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>In his memo, Oksenberg informed Brzezinski that during the “hectic days” before the normalization communique was finalized, the National Security Council “never saw” the Chinese version of the text because it “worked entirely from the English.” Right before the normalization communique was released, the U.S. Liaison Office (USLO) in Beijing assured Oksenberg that there were “no problems” with the Chinese translation. Afterward, the USLO explained to Oksenberg that it had noticed the insertion of “chengren” but decided not to inform Washington, because Chinese officials used “several English-Chinese dictionaries” to argue that there was “no substantive significance” to the new translation.</p><p>Oksenberg disagreed. He worried that the administration had “tampered with the ‘holy writ’ of the Shanghai Communique” and that “more than a few linguists” would say that “chengren” “denotes a stronger acceptance of the Chinese position” than “renshi dao.” Oksenberg implied that, had he seen the draft Chinese text, Washington would have pushed back.</p><p>The ramifications of this change were potentially significant. U.S. supporters of the Taiwanese regime, which had built a formidable China lobby in Washington, could have seized on the more conciliatory Chinese phrasing to portray Carter administration officials as dupes and bolster resistance to normalization policies on Capitol Hill.</p><p>To avoid these minefields, Oksenberg recommended a three-pronged defense: First, both governments had “worked from the English text”; second, the U.S. view was “expressed in the English”; and third, “chengren” was used by other countries with China. Brzezinski underlined the words “expressed in the English” and wrote “Yes. ZB.” Then-Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher later confirmed during congressional debates that the United States would “regard the English text as being the binding text.”</p><p>Beijing, however, saw the Chinese text as equally binding. The Foreign Ministry’s official history of U.S.-China relations foregrounds the United States’ agreement to “chengren” — Beijing‘s view on Taiwan.</p><p>And the conflict wasn’t simply one of language. It seems that Beijing took advantage of the American preference for English-first negotiations to advance its own foreign policy goals. Shi Yanhua, a government translator who worked on the normalization communique, recalled years later that she was present when Zhang Wenjin, a senior diplomat who had helped draft the document, purposefully changed “renshi dao” to “chengren” because the latter term was “more in line” with Beijing’s policy on Taiwan. These facts contradicted the assurances provided to the USLO that the new translation had “no substantive significance.”</p><p>This disclosure indicates that the USLO’s failure to object to the new Chinese text was a blunder, one that could have either strained U.S.-Chinese relations or pinned the United States to a policy that it did not support.</p><p>Fortunately for Washington, the Chinese, preoccupied with domestic development and strategic competition with the Soviet Union and Vietnam, chose to do little as the United States turned its own understanding of the agreement into policy in the region. In April 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act created a legal basis for the de facto diplomatic relations that still exist between the United States and Taiwan. The Six Assurances offered to Taiwan in 1982 affirmed that the United States “would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.”</p><p>That does not mean, however, that China’s linguistic chicanery was meaningless. Domestically, it helped fortify the legitimacy of Beijing’s claim to Taiwan, supporting a version of China in which its Communist Party controls Taipei.</p><p>And the history of this mistake may not be over. As China seeks increasingly to “set the parameters of acceptable discourse” in global affairs, especially with regard to its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, the words of the normalization communique may still become potent weapons of statecraft, diplomatic ammunition in a potential (if contentious) case for sovereignty should Beijing ever decide to force the issue of reunification with Taiwan.</p><p>This blunder was not a one-off occurrence. Over the past 40 years, Western observers often overlooked what Beijing was saying about its national ambitions. The policy of engagement that Washington has pursued with China may have been its best option, but if successive administrations had taken Beijing’s words more seriously, the United States might have been more proactive in safeguarding the international order from the political, economic and security challenges posed by an authoritarian superpower — challenges that have necessitated a new trade agreement today.</p><p>With U.S.-China relations at their lowest ebb in two decades, and the two countries’ governments increasingly divided over issues of trade, technology, geopolitics and human rights, the normalization communique is a lesson in the overconfidence that led many Americans to overlook Chinese intentions.</p><p>The Trump administration must not let China pull another fast one as it translates this new agreement. Because, for Beijing, reality is not “expressed in the English.”</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qcQ5lNwUrJcNYe2avGWm-MarXPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLHCXBC6IMI6RNSWENWGEFHPAE.jpg'),(16,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/23/taiwans-bikini-hiker-dies-after-falling-into-ravine-solo-trek/','The Washington Post',NULL,'Taiwan\'s \'bikini hiker\' dies after falling into ravine on solo trek',NULL,NULL,'Amy B Wang','1548268145000',1548268145000,'<p>If there was any doubt that hiking was Gigi Wu’s passion, a visit to her social media accounts would have put that to rest.</p><p>Her Facebook page was a veritable tour of Taiwan’s tallest peaks and most scenic mountain ranges.

',NULL,'Ketian Vivian Zhang','1554717670000',1554717670000,'<p>On March 31, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that two Chinese Air Force (PLAAF) J-11 jets crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait. This violated the long-held tacit agreement between China and Taiwan that neither side should cross the median line.</p><p>Taiwan deemed this “an intentional, reckless & provocative action,” which triggered “a 10-minute standoff” in the air. As Asia security expert Bonnie S. Glaser notes that, if intentional, this would be the first PLAAF crossing of the median line in about 20 years. In this case, it’s likely that Taiwan, not the South China Sea, prompted Beijing’s actions.</p><p>An unresolved issue from the Chinese civil war, Taiwan has always been a “core interest” to party leaders in Beijing. Here are some key takeaways from my research on China-Taiwan relations.</p><h3>What does the PLAAF move signal?</h3><p>Granted, there is much we don’t know about this specific PLAAF incident. But my work on cross-Strait relations suggests that it’s quite possible the PLAAF behavior is intentional — and serves as a coercive signal to Taiwan and the United States. Here’s what you need to know:</p><h3>1. The U.S. agreed to sell fighter jets to Taiwan. </h3><p>In March, the United States agreed to sell F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan — the fourth-generation model. The last U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan took place in September 1992.</p><p>[China-U.S.-Taiwan relations are in choppy waters. Here’s what’s going on.]</p><p>Beijing considers selling weapons platforms such as jet fighters and submarines to Taiwan an implicit red line. In the past, China used coercion to deter countries from selling these weapons platforms to Taiwan. This suggests that last week’s PLAAF incident is intended to send a deterrent signal about fighter sales to both Taiwan and the United States.</p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Defense lodged protests against the United States regarding the sale, reiterating that China will “take all necessary measures” to resolutely defend its sovereignty. The Trump administration decided on April 5 to put on hold the F-16V deal until the United States strikes a trade deal with China, suggesting that China may have used the bilateral trade talks as a bargaining chip.</p><h3>2. U.S. ships were in the Taiwan Strait. </h3><p>On March 24, U.S. naval and Coast Guard ships passed through the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese Foreign Ministry protested, urging the United States to exercise caution.</p><h3>3. Taiwan’s president stopped off in Hawaii. </h3><p>That same week, Tsai Ing-wen made a U.S. stopover. China protested that this was in violation of the “one China” policy, which calls for the United States and other countries to refrain from official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</p><p>These actions appear to be relatively minor provocations in China’s ledger. But to Beijing, not taking coercive actions to demonstrate its resolve might produce more provocative actions from Taiwan and the United States in the future.</p><h3>How does China use its tools of coercion?</h3><p>In the past, China has utilized both military and nonmilitary tools to force Taiwan and other countries to stop and deter actions that China deems threatening. My book project suggests that China uses these tools selectively. And Beijing tends to target the United States less, because of China’s economic vulnerability vis-a-vis the United States.</p><p>[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]</p><p>Here’s an example. When France sold Mirage 2000 fighter jets Taiwan in 1992, China responded with harsh diplomatic and economic sanctions, including a ban on French wheat exports to China, awarding a subway bid in China’s southern city of Guangzhou to Germany, freezing a French project to build a nuclear power plant in China and closing the French consulate in Guangzhou.</p><p>In this case, China had “exit options.” For instance, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were all bidding on the Guangzhou subway project. The Chinese ambassador to France stated in his memoir that China turned to Germany to sanction France.</p><h3>Fear of U.S. economic retaliation held China back in 1992.</h3><p>Concerns about U.S.-China economic relations kept Beijing from giving a similar response after the 1992 U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan. Just 12 days after the sale, Congress passed a bill linking Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status with Chinese human rights conditions.</p><p>Evidence from my working paper reveals that Chinese government analysts during the 1992 F-16 episode waited anxiously. Would President George H.W. Bush veto the conditional extension of MFN status — and would Congress then overturn the veto? Bush eventually vetoed the bill, 26 days after the sale.</p><p>Losing MFN status would be detrimental to China’s exports, a former World Bank official in charge of China confirmed to me. And China and the United States were slated to engage in market entry negotiations three weeks after the weapons sales. The U.S. trade representative threatened 100 percent tariffs on $4 billion worth of Chinese goods if the two sides did not reach an agreement.</p><p>[The U.S. and China are playing a dangerous game. What comes next?]</p><p>China expert John W. Garver writes that Deng Xiaoping endorsed an internal Chinese Foreign Ministry report at the time, because “China needed to give priority to economic interests” and avoid a trade war in which Beijing stood to lose the most.</p><p>By 1994, President Clinton had delinked MFN status from Chinese human rights conditions. China subsequently responded with coercion in 1995 when Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui gave a talk at Cornell University and Taiwan held elections in 1996. Beijing conducted missile tests and recalled the Chinese ambassador to the United States.</p><p>These measures, Beijing hoped, would deter the United States and other countries from granting Lee a visa in the future, which China perceived as supporting Taiwan’s path toward de jure independence.</p><p>In this light, President Tsai Ing-wen’s recent transit via Hawaii and meetings with senior U.S. leaders could be a contributing factor to China’s reactions. Barring an official invitation for the Taiwanese president to visit the United States, Chinese coercion regarding these transits probably will focus on Taiwan. China’s goal, most likely, is to deter Taiwanese leaders from transiting via the United States or meeting with senior U.S. officials in the future.</p><p>China and Taiwan have long had a tense relationship. But as Chinese economic clout increased, Beijing began to threaten economic and diplomatic sanctions against U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan. In the long run, if China successfully diversifies its export markets and becomes less dependent on U.S.-China trade, Beijing is likely to become more coercive — especially regarding Taiwan.</p><p>Ketian Vivian Zhang is a postdoctoral fellow at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.

He suspects it all started the previous day.

Thinking it was only dirt, she cleaned her eye out with water and did not rub her eyes much for the rest of the day. She didn’t think much of it until her eyes began to swell up that night and she experienced a stinging pain that made her tear up.</p><p>It would have been very likely for sweat bees to be around He at the time, Hung told reporters, as they tend to nest near graves and in the mountains.</p><p>At the hospital the following day, when Hung discovered that the sweat bees were feasting on He’s tears, the doctor was relieved that the woman, who wore contacts, had not rubbed her eyes excessively when the pain worsened, Hung told the BBC. If she had, it could have worsened her inflamed cornea or potentially led to blindness, Apple Daily Taiwan and other media outlets reported.</p><p>Matan Shelomi, an associate professor of entomology at National Taiwan University, told The Washington Post that he had never heard of sweat bees infesting a person before the recent incident.</p><p>“To my knowledge, this is the first case of a bee or a wasp getting caught in a part of a person’s anatomy, as far as I know,” he said. “I’m sure the sweat bees got by the eye and got squished between the eye and eyelid. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</p><p>In addition to needing pollen and nectar like other bees, Shelomi said, sweat bees, which are dark-colored and metallic, will occasionally need salt to supplement their diet. A study this month from the Kansas Entomological Society found that sweat bees also look to tears as a protein source.</p><p>“They don’t seem to be bothered by people, so they will go to any source of salt,\" Shelomi said. \"I think they’re kind of dumb if they come to humans for their salt. They haven’t figured out what we are.”</p><p>While there are more than 1,000 species of sweat bees in the United States, Canada and Central America, according to Terminix, they are almost painless and sting only when they are provoked. On the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, a scale of relative agony caused by sawflies, wasps, bees and ants, the sweat bee comes in at the lowest level of pain. Described by the index as “light, ephemeral, almost fruity,” the puny sting is compared to “a tiny spark [that] has singed a single hair on your arm.”</p><p>“She couldn’t have asked for a better bee to sting her in her eye,” Shelomi said.</p><p>He was discharged and is expected to make a full recovery, KRON-TV reported. The bees are still alive, Hung told the BBC, and will now be studied.</p><p>“This is the first time in Taiwan we’ve seen something like this,” the doctor said.</p><p>Even though the case is probably the most unusual he’s heard about in his time studying entomology, Shelomi emphasized that what happened at the gravesite in Taiwan was a fascinating but not worrisome “freak occurrence.”</p><p>“The woman will be fine. The bees will be fine,” Shelomi stressed. “This is not something that people need to concern themselves with. I don’t expect we’ll ever see it again.”</p><p>More from Morning Mix:</p><p>A ‘selfless’ high school principal donated bone marrow to a stranger.

',NULL,'Zhiqun Zhu','1547678767000',1547678767000,'<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping made a high-profile speech regarding Taiwan on Jan. 2 to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1979 “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan.” That 1979 speech was the Chinese government’s first policy overture to Taiwan, which replaced “liberation of Taiwan” with “peaceful unification” as the goal. Xi’s speech marking the occasion has generated heated debates about Taiwan-China relations.</p><p>Based on Taiwan’s official reactions so far, one can expect a stormy relationship between the two sides in the next couple of years — a battle that is sure to become part of the current tensions between the United States and China.</p><p>Right after World War II, the Chinese civil war resumed between Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist forces and Mao Zedong’s communist guerrillas. Chiang was defeated and moved his Republic of China government to Taiwan, while Mao declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China on the mainland in 1949. The two sides remained bitter enemies and had no official contact during much of the Cold War. Relations gradually improved since the 1980s as Taiwan lifted martial law and the mainland started to open up.</p><p>Over the years, a distinct Taiwanese identity has grown while the Chinese identity has declined in Taiwan. Since Taiwan became a multiparty democracy, cross-strait relations have become more complicated. But when Ma Ying-jeou was in power in Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, Taiwan-China relations were stable and friendly, and cross-strait exchanges were dynamic.</p><p>That changed with the election of the Democratic Progressive Party’s Tsai Ing-wen as president of the Republic of China in 2016, and the relationship between Beijing and Taiwan has been characterized by stalemate over the past few years. From Beijing’s perspective, 2019 was a fitting time to send a new message — and a new warning — to Taiwan. A man with a sense of historical mission, Xi has been seriously eyeing Taiwan as part of his “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation. As he stated confidently in his speech, Taiwan must and will be united with the motherland.</p><p>In his speech, Xi reiterated Beijing’s long-standing policy toward Taiwan, with “national unification” as the objective and “One Country, Two Systems” as the model. In this sense, Xi’s speech is a continuation of previous official statements, which focused on Beijing’s intent for peaceful reunification and cross-strait exchanges while reserving the right to use force, if necessary.</p><p>But Xi’s speech also contained something new. First, he introduced more flexibility to the “One Country, Two Systems” model proposed for Taiwan. That’s important, because China operates under a “One Country, Two Systems” model elsewhere, in its relationship with Hong Kong and Macao. Xi is undoubtedly aware of the grim reality in Hong Kong, where frustration is growing over how Beijing has rapidly undermined the city’s political institutions, democratic activism and media freedom.</p><p>Not wanting to replicate that situation with Taiwan, Xi is making a significant policy adjustment. In contrast to the Hong Kong case, where the “One Country, Two Systems” model was imposed in 1997 without input from the Hong Kong people, what Xi is suggesting is involving the Taiwanese in developing a new model for Taiwan. The move injects a level of self-determination for Taiwan into the unification model.</p><p>Xi also proposed that representatives from different parties and walks of life in Taiwan should join Beijing in political consultations to discuss cross-strait relations and make political arrangements for Taiwan’s future. This might be the most intriguing and innovative part of his speech since it essentially kicks off the unification process by sidestepping the unpopular governing party. He did not set a timetable for unification, but this proposal, if implemented, would represent a giant stride toward Beijing’s goal of unification with specific steps being taken to prepare for the future.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the Tsai administration immediately and categorically rejected Xi’s proposal without much deliberation. Were the Tsai administration open to discussions, or willing to offer a plan to improve cross-strait relations, Taiwan could use its vibrant democracy as a tool to shape the future of the Chinese mainland. Beijing says anything can be discussed under “one China”; Taiwan certainly can and should raise its preconditions for unification. That would put tremendous pressure on the mainland to move toward democratization.</p><p>Tsai’s position toward the mainland hardened last year. Now she only uses “China” to refer to the mainland instead of the more conciliatory “Chinese mainland” that she used during her first year in office. In Taiwan, when politicians refer to the mainland as “China”, it’s a clear indication of their anti-China and pro-independence position. </p><p>Tsai’s shift toward a more hard-line approach has many possible causes: loss of five diplomatic allies of the ROC during her term so far; perceived “bullying” by Beijing in international arenas; her strategy to play the China card to deflect internal discontent toward her lackluster performance; and her party’s loss in local elections last year.</p><p>Though Xi has offered more flexibility in the unification process, it is clear that Beijing’s “wait and see” attitude toward Tsai is over. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office has for the first time publicly lashed out at Tsai as a “separatist.” It’s almost certain that Tsai will become more hard-line before the 2020 Taiwan elections as she struggles to be reelected. Her leadership has been disappointing to most Taiwanese, including her supporters. To be tough on China and brand herself as a leader to defend Taiwan’s sovereignty may help her win back some votes.</p><p>Xi’s firm determination and Tsai’s strong resistance suggest that the Taiwan Strait will not be calm in the next couple of years. That has real implications for the United States. Tsai will strive to strengthen relations with the United States while maintaining an anti-China stance. And there is reason to believe Washington will be amenable to her overtures. President Trump signed several pro-Taiwan bills into law in 2018, including the Taiwan Travel Act and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, moves that Beijing resents.</p><p>The U.S. government will likely continue to play the Taiwan card when dealing with China, but Taiwan’s people must be cautious and sober. It is not inconceivable that someday Trump may decide to sell out Taiwan in order to strike a deal with China. Taiwan’s future is inextricably linked to China’s. Instead of turning away from China, Taiwan may wish to work with Beijing and seek a mutually acceptable outcome for the island democracy.</p><p>This post has been updated.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IT_a6-bPDQqr044P1Mo0zlAYsi0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LKA3U7ANOII6TDYMN6DYUJRIRI.jpg'),(22,'http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/09/two-views-tom-dundon-carolina-hurricanes-savior-aaf-scourge/','The Washington Post',NULL,'The two views of Tom Dundon: Carolina Hurricanes\' savior and AAF scourge','A relatively unknown Texas businessman is making headlines with bold moves that have produced varying results',NULL,'Rick Maese','1554864967000',1554864967000,'<p>Tom Dundon was able to build his fortune without fame, found success far from the spotlight and seemed to have all the answers, even if there was no real public questioning.</p><p>“I never did any interviews and never wanted any attention,” Dundon said.</p><p>There’s no avoiding it now. Suddenly, there is a whole lot to talk about — and even more that he says he can’t talk about. In his first full season as professional sports team owner, Dundon’s Carolina Hurricanes are back in the NHL playoffs, snapping the league’s longest dry spell and drawing the spotlight to the on-ice party in one of the league’s smallest markets.</p><p>“Given where the franchise has been, just this step of getting to the playoffs and not having to talk any more, not think any more about what used to be,” Dundon said in an interview this week. “We can now be pretty focused on what we want the Hurricanes to be going forward.”</p><p>Depending on one’s viewpoint, the Hurricanes are either the feel-good story of the NHL season or an affront to hockey’s tradition of stoic celebration. And their 47-year-old owner in his first full season is either a disrupter who bought an organization in need of disruption or the leader of a “bunch of jerks.” And it’s just possible that all those things are sort of true.</p><p>“Listen, there was some shaking that needed to be done,” NBC analyst Mike Milbury said. “… Whatever the formula was that was used down there, it’s shaken out a pretty good team, a team that’s made the playoffs for the first time in forever.”</p><p>But Dundon’s soaring Q rating in the sports world is largely due to his association with the Alliance of American Football, a minor league operation that had garnered attention for its heady ambitions and quick demise. As his Hurricanes take the ice against the Washington Capitals in the opening round this week, Dundon is still picking up the pieces from his short-lived, high-priced foray into professional football.</p><p>[As Capitals prepare Stanley Cup defense, Todd Reirden\'s son faces an ongoing battle]</p><p>In January he swooped in as a savior, pledging $250 million to rescue a league that was struggling to pay its bills. But less than seven weeks later, Dundon decided to pull the plug eight games into the AAF’s inaugural season, cutting his losses — estimated at $70 million — and dooming a start-up just as it was getting started.</p><p>Although rumors had been swirling, the swift ax caught many by surprise. Team and league officials were given no advance warning, and the handling of the situation has been roundly criticized. Players, coaches and team employees stopped drawing a salary immediately. Many were left stranded in cities without housing and forced to pay for flights home. Those who were injured were suddenly on the hook for necessary medical expenses.</p><p>“My thing is, I don’t know who the dude is — Tom Dundon, whatever his name is — you could have at least finished out the season, these last two games,” said Taiwan Jones, a former Michigan State player who signed with the AAF team in Memphis barely 24 hours before the league folded. “…You took that away. You could have folded this at the end of the season.”</p><p>Dundon declined to answer questions this week about the football league, citing ongoing legal issues that need to be worked out. Last week, the league put out an unsigned statement, saying: “We understand the difficulty that this decision has caused for many people and for that we are very sorry. This is not the way we wanted it to end, but we are also committed to working on solutions for all outstanding issues to the best of our ability.”</p><p>[This linebacker broke his arm playing in the AAF. Three days later the league folded.]</p><p>A maverick making calculated risks</p><p>The recent hockey turnaround and the football flop are among the most high-profile business dealings of Dundon’s wildly successful career. He has a net worth that has been estimated around $1 billion, built largely from working in financial services and auto lending after a failed foray into the food industry. His financial firm is based in Dallas, where he attended Southern Methodist University. His splashy venture into the sports world has garnered attention and made headlines, but his approach shouldn’t surprise anyone who followed his career marked by bold ideas, calculated decisions and big results.</p><p>“I try to measure every risk,” he said, speaking generally about business philosophy and his hockey franchise. “I don’t think we do anything that’s not measured. … I’m not a risk-taker. I’m not going to jump out of an airplane with a parachute.”</p><p>In NHL circles, Dundon has quickly established himself as a maverick of sorts, an owner who didn’t need to sit in the background or rely on an old playbook. He purchased controlling interest of the franchise for $420 million, taking over in January 2018. The franchise was floundering, struggling in the standings and in the stands.</p><p>Thirteen years had passed since Carolina’s Stanley Cup championship and 10 since its previous postseason appearance. It was time for change, even if some were uneasy about what that might mean.</p><p>“The truth is, we have a small group of very passionate fans. The job was to grow that number,” Dundon said. “So there wasn’t a lot of risk when you\'re on the lower end. We only had upside.”</p><p>After just a couple of months of ownership, Dundon demoted general manager Ron Francis, perhaps the franchise’s greatest player and wildly popular with fans. He was later fired, though his jersey still hangs from the rafters at PNC Arena. The coach, Bill Peters, resigned after the season. Dundon eventually gave his interim GM Don Waddell the job permanently and promoted assistant coach Rod Brind’Amour, who was a captain on Carolina’s championship team, to head coach.</p><p>[Capitals\' title defense will begin against red-hot, scrappy Hurricanes]</p><p>He was disruptive, challenging his staff to rethink the way it did things and scrutinize costs. Nothing was sacred, and not everything was popular. Radio play-by-play announcer Chuck Kaiton had covered the franchise since its inaugural season in 1979, moving from Hartford, Conn., to Raleigh and never missing a game. He was reportedly offered an 80 percent pay cut last spring, which was essentially an invitation to leave.</p><p>“He sees things differently and doesn’t get emotional about his decisions” is how a friend, Charlotte Jones Anderson, a Dallas Cowboys executive vice president, once explained Dundon to the Dallas Morning News.</p><p>In Dundon’s other businesses, his track record lent credibility to his new ideas. “The difference here is you come in and you want to do something different — people start off thinking, ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about because you’re not a hockey person or you haven’t been in the sports business,’\" he said. \" … I wouldn’t want to overstate that as being difficult, just that it’s different.”</p><p>Presiding over ‘a bunch of jerks’</p><p>Dundon liked what he was seeing on the roster and behind the scenes. The team drafted Andrei Svechnikov with the second pick, signed free agent goaltender Petr Mrazek to a team-friendly one-year, $1.5 million deal and acquired winger Micheal Ferland and defenseman Dougie Hamilton in a trade with Calgary. The team later named Justin Williams its captain and would see 21-year-old Sebastian Aho continue to blossom into a dominant first-line center.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Perhaps the most visible change came following home wins this season, when the Hurricanes received considerable attention for their elaborately choreographed postgame celebrations. Players did a limbo line under a hockey stick and played duck-duck-goose on the ice. Williams used his helmet as a bowling ball, knocking down teammates lined up like pins, and a pair of players fished from the bench, reeling in a teammate flopping on the ice.</p><p>“All those little celebrations somehow managed to be a cohesive thing for them, despite getting some pretty strong criticism from up north,” Milbury said.</p><p>Old-school purists with ice in their veins weren’t amused. Canadian analyst Don Cherry called the Hurricanes “a bunch of jerks.” Rather than kowtow to traditionalists, the team responded by printing T-shirts that read “A bunch of jerks.” They sold several thousand, and the team had an identity.</p><p>“I think it’s been great,” Dundon told ESPN. “I’m glad [Cherry’s] talking about us. People don’t always talk about the Hurricanes, so I hope he keeps talking about us.”</p><p>While some bristled when the team opted to wear Hartford Whalers jerseys for a pair of games, many more started taking notice of what the Hurricanes were doing. Attendance increased more than 15 percent on the season, and according to a team official, new season ticket sales are up 260 percent from this time a year ago.</p><p>“He is a very smart guy, and he applied what worked for him in his other businesses to Carolina,” Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks’ owner, said in an email. “It’s obviously worked for him.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs feels different than other business success, he said, in part because it’s a shared accomplishment and the culmination of months and months of work. “I wasn’t looking to be vindicated,” he said. “I just wanted the organization to take this step because things tend to be easier when you’re talking about the future versus the past. We don’t have to talk about the past any more.”</p><p>But people continue to talk about his role in ending the AAF midseason, even as Dundon maintains his silence on the matter.</p><p>“He was in a bad spot but it also seems like he doesn’t care,” Jones said. \"He didn’t come out and make a [personal] statement or nothing because it doesn’t affect him — which it doesn’t. You have money.”</p><p>Dundon knows for now people are talking about him and his loud entrance into the sports world. That wasn’t his goal, but at least they’re talking, he figures, particularly about the future of the Hurricanes.</p><p>“When I bought the team, I realized the Carolina Hurricanes weren’t a topic of conversation in the world, and they have to be,” Dundon said. “Long-term, it needs to be about our players and our coaching. But short-term, I felt like I had to help. I think you’ll find over time that I’ll move into the shadows. The more the team is the story, the better.”</p><p>Tramel Raggs contributed to this report.</p>',NULL,NULL,'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c1_vUGKQtmJyPIlibd9pkUL7CUw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W5ESUYBULII6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg');
